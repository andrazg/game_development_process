	abstract = {Playing entertainment computer, video, and portable games, namely, digital games, is receiving more and more attention in academic research. Games are studied in different situations with numerous methods, but little is known about if and how the playing situation affects the user experience ({UX}) in games. In addition, it is hard to understand and study the psychology of {UX} in games. The objective of this study is to show how {UX} differs when the first-person shooter {HALO} is played in a laboratory and at home. To disclose this difference, a psychologically valid and multidimensional measurement framework is introduced. {UX} is profiled according to the level of the sense of presence, involvement, and flow in a between-subjects design. Statistically, the structure of the framework is grounded on a large and heterogeneous gamer data set (N = 2,182). The results showed that the profile of the sense of presence in the laboratory included higher levels of attention and arousal as compared with that of the natural environment. This finding was independent of any of the measured background variables. Other differences between the two situations were more related to the participants’ background. For example, gamers at home were more involved in the game and they felt a higher level of competence. No strong emotional differences between the two situations were found. The authors discuss the complex {UX} terminology and implications of the framework for implementation of learning games.},

	abstract = {“Unraveling Braid” analyzes how unconventional, non-linear narrative fiction can help explain the ways in which video games signify. Specifically, this essay looks at the links between the semiotic features of Jonathan Blow’s 2008 puzzle-platform video game Braid and similar elements in Georges Perec’s 1978 novel Life A User’s Manual, as well as in other puzzle-themed literary precursors. Blow’s game design concepts “dynamical meaning” and “game play rhetoric” are explained in relation to a number of Braid levels; along side this analysis is a parallel examination of the relationship between puzzle-makers and puzzle-solvers in Life A User’s Manual, revealed from a close reading of textual and organizational elements of Perec’s novel. Ultimately, Braid and Life A User’s Manual are shown to draw upon the same signifying processes, which are understood by their authors to operate within an implicitly communicative model. “Unraveling Braid”develops this model by positing a theory of storytelling in the imperative mood, in which the representation and arrangement of objects in the visual/organizational space of the text or game world becomes a fundamental rhetorical technique and meaning-maker.This technique signal show the reader/player is meant to progress through the work and interpret it as narrative, telling the reader/player what to do (but not necessarily how to do it). An understanding of “imperative” storytelling, this essay concludes, allows for a discussion of games and other media that denies neither the importance of player interactivity nor that of authorial design.},

However, gaming can be a highly social activity. This article extends the methodological focus from single player to include multiple simultaneous players. A physiological metric for investigating social experience within a shared gaming context is introduced: Physiological linkage is measured by gathering simultaneous psychophysiological measurements from several players. The authors review how physiological linkage may be associated with social presence among participants in various gaming situations or social contexts. These metrics provide such information about the interaction among participants that is not currently available by any other method. The authors discuss various measures used to calculate linkage, the related social processes, and how to use physiological linkage in game experience research.},

This article follows this reasoning and focuses on game enjoyment in later life. This topic is explored through two qualitative studies with actively playing older adults. The first study (n = 35, aged between 49 and 73) took place in Flanders (the Dutch-speaking part of Belgium), while the second study (n = 40, aged between 44 and 77) was held in the U.S.A. (Virginia and Kentucky). Using the principles of Grounded Theory, three interpretations of game enjoyment in later life were identified, namely, telic, hedonic, and eudaimonic enjoyment. The article offers a number of design recommendations based on its findings and discusses how the interpretations are influenced by context and player gender, and are subject to change throughout the life span of an aging player.},

We reviewed the available literature on serious games that are used to teach social interactions to individuals with {ASD}. After screening the Medline, Science Direct and {ACM} Digital Library databases, we found a total of 31 serious games: 16 that targeted emotion recognition or production and 15 that targeted social skills. There was a significant correlation between the number of reports per year and the year of publication. Serious games appeared promising because they can support training on many different skills and they favour interactions in diverse contexts and situations, some of which may resemble real life. However, the currently available serious games exhibit some limitations: (i) most of them are developed for High-Functioning individuals; (ii) their clinical validation has rarely met the evidence-based medicine standards; (iii) the game design is not usually described; and, (iv) in many cases, the clinical validation and playability/game design are not compatible.
Future research agendas should encompass (i) more robust studies in terms of methodology (large samples, control groups, longer treatment periods, follow-up to assess whether changes remain stable, etc.) to assess serious game efficacy; (ii) more collaboration between clinical and computer/game design experts; and (iii) more serious games that are adapted to Low-Functioning {ASD} individuals.},

In these games, players develop their skills by facing a number of challenges, and students are assessed according to their game playing behaviour. Assessment of serious game-based learning experiences has to take into account diverse features as game genre, pedagogical aim or game context. This paper analyses how skills are usually assessed in learning experiences based on serious games. To reach this objective, a systematic mapping study of more than 400 papers is undertaken. Papers were identified and classified according to a framework based on four categories: assessment aim, implementation, integration and primary assessment type. The reviewed literature mainly deals with contributions on methods and approaches for serious games. Results have revealed that most assessment methods are applied for a formative purpose more than for a certification purpose. Most frequent implementations such as game scoring and integrations like monitoring states were also uncovered. The main primary type of assessment detected was in-process. In addition, several limitations were found in the assessment methods: regarding the aim of assessment, certification of previous or attained skills was usually implemented out of the game; the scope of some implementations was limited because results were predefined earlier; and most of methods analysed present scalability issues because they rely on manual assessments. Such findings are analysed and discussed to clarify the state of the art and provide recommendations for further work in the area of serious games-based learning.},

	abstract = {Global competition and individual customer requirements generate challenges for manufacturing companies. To cope with these challenges, companies require an increased level of flexibility. In the first place, this flexibility has to be provided by the employees, as they are one of the key success factors for mastering change. An essential prerequisite for this is a high level of employee qualification across all areas of the company.
The learning factories approach has garnered particular attention in recent years as a playful and efficient way of learning the principles and methods of processes improvement. The drawbacks of this method include the limited, non-holistic perspective of each trainee as well as the non-recurring knowledge transfer. Moreover, this kind of qualification requires the trainees to be in the same place at the same time.
These downsides can be successfully countered by supplementing learning factories with a digital learning component depicting the learning environment, as digital learning will enable individual learning routes for all trainees and is accessible at all times and all places.
This paper serves to outline the idea of serious learning by using digital learning games along with the attendant benefits. Over and beyond this, it also presents a digital learning game for teaching specific lean production methods.},

We set out to answer the question of whether or not it is necessary to indicate an educational game as a learning material (in contrast to pure entertainment) to facilitate learning relevant for school. Research on entertainment media suggests that the implementation of such a learning instruction increases learners’ investment of mental effort and, thus, the learning outcome. Then again, learning instruction as an extrinsic incentive might negatively influence intrinsic motivation and extraneous cognitive load. Therefore, this study examines the effects of learning instruction on students’ intrinsic motivation, cognitive load, and learning with a digital educational game. We carried out a one-factor (learning instruction: yes/no) experimental design with N = 150 participants (age 13 to 17). Results indicate that the learning instruction increased task-irrelevant processing and decreased the learning outcome. Thus, adding an explicit learning instruction is not recommended. On the contrary, our results suggest that playing just for fun enhances the effectiveness of such a learning environment.},

	abstract = {Serious environmental management games can improve understanding of practical environmental sustainability challenges by offering opportunities to obtain first-hand experiences that may be otherwise too costly, difficult or dangerous to reproduce in reality. Game-based learning ({GBL}) has been found to increase soft skills, such as critical thinking, creative problem solving and teamwork, as well as to improve cognitive development, learning retention and social learning, which are important for future environmental researchers and professionals. Environmental management games can be applied in educational settings to promote awareness about sustainable resource planning and management among citizens who are increasingly exposed to products of the information age. This paper provides an overview of game-based learning and the state of serious games ({SG}) for environmental management, offering insight into their potential as effective tools in facilitating environmental education. {SGs} have been shown to possess numerous qualities that have been connected with improved learning experiences and cognitive development, but research must continue to study the {SGs}’ efficacy. Shortcomings found with games reviewed are that few evaluate or explain pedagogical foundation, and many are hard to implement or not accessible. Methods employed in determining the effectiveness of {SGs} vary greatly among environmental studies, necessitating a standardized methodology to reduce disparities in testing procedures. Furthermore, a centralized source, effectively an online database for {SGs}, is needed for locating and obtaining information pertaining to the available environmental games and their most appropriate applications.},

However, today games are also increasingly being employed for a variety of instrumental purposes. Although games have garnered a substantial amount of research attention during the last decade, research literature is scattered and there is still a lack of a clear and reliable understanding of why games are being used, and how they are placed in the established utilitarian-hedonic continuum of information systems. To address this gap, we conducted a meta-analysis of the quantitative body of literature that has examined the reasons for using games (48 studies). Additionally, we compared the findings across games that are intended for either leisure or instrumental use. Even though games are generally regarded as a pinnacle form of hedonically-oriented {ISs}, our results show that enjoyment and usefulness are equally important determinants for using them (though their definitive role varies between game types). Therefore, it can be posited that games are multi-purpose {ISs} which nevertheless rely on hedonic factors, even in the pursuit of instrumental outcomes. The present study contributes to and advances our theoretical and empirical understanding of multi-purpose {ISs} and the ways in which they are used.},

	abstract = {Development of a game in the form of software for game-based learning poses significant technical challenges for educators, researchers, game designers, and software engineers. The game development consists of a set of complex processes requiring multi-faceted knowledge in multiple disciplines such as digital graphic design, education, gaming, instructional design, modeling and simulation, psychology, software engineering, visual arts, and the learning subject area. Planning and managing such a complex multidisciplinary development project require a unifying methodology and should not be performed in an ad hoc manner. This paper presents such a methodology named {GAMED} ({diGital} {educAtional} {gaMe} {dEvelopment} {methoDology}). {GAMED} consists of a body of methods, rules, and postulates and is embedded within a digital educational game life cycle. The life cycle describes a framework for organization of the phases, processes, work products, quality assurance activities, and project management activities required to develop, use, maintain, and evolve a digital educational game from birth to retirement. {GAMED} provides a modular structured approach for overcoming the development complexity and guides the developers throughout the entire life cycle.},

As these games increase in popularity and usage, more attention should be paid to their design. Currently, there is a lack of design processes that provide both structure and room for creative development of such games. This article presents a preliminary process for design of {DCGs}. The design process involves the application of cognitive toys and isomorphism. Using this process, designers will use a cognitive toy to be inspired to develop {DCGs}, and isomorphism is intended to help them produce a diverse set of {DCGs} based on the same cognitive toy. The resulting {DCGs} will have deep similarity with the original cognitive toy but are unique in terms of their surface features.},

	abstract = {Art education has been in the midst of a transformation shaped by several factors, including changes in contemporary art theories, political and economic factors, and technological developments. Film, music videos, advertisements, video games and other forms of popular culture are shaping how students learn today. Discussions about video gaming typically have turned to concerns about a recurring narrative, focusing on violence with sexist and racist content, found in games such as Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas (2004). Today, educators and researchers recognize the potential of video games to engage players in multi-sensory, complex learning processes. Games that promote social action have become popular over the past 5 years and have represented a new genre of games that researchers from a range of disciplines are beginning to investigate. This discussion of video games examines simulation, situated learning, and social realism gaming schemas as well as social reconstructionist art education. Specifically, the article explores the videogames Peacemaker (2006) and Darfur is Dying (2006) and their potential for learning in a social reconstructionist art education context.},

This analysis considers how the games in the Ravenhearst trilogy both reinforce and complicate expectations of women gamers through repurposing the gothic romance. While the series does not market itself exclusively to women, the narrative specifically places the player in the subject position that implies a heterosexual female. By tapping into gothic genre expectations the games help to marginalize the player within the larger scope of video games. The games play with gothic storytelling style, yet push against many traditional conventions of the genre, illustrating how digital spaces have begun to rewrite traditional narrative conventions, but still maintain their gendered affectations. Through gaming, the gothic romance premise is reproduced, but ultimately shifts the player from the role of an onlooker to the subject position of victimized protagonist.},

	abstract = {Background: The emergence of a participatory culture, brought about mainly by the use of Web2.0 technology, is challenging us to reconsider aspects of teaching and learning. Adapting the learning-as-digital-game-building approach, this paper explores how new educational practices can help students build skills for the 21st century. Purpose: This paper examines elementary students' learning experiences through digital game building and playing. The following research questions guided the study: (1) What emotions do students experience during the process of building digital games for others to use?; (2) What traits do students display when they learn through digital game-building?; and (3) What do students learn from the digital game-building experience? Sample: The participants were 21 elementary students (19 boys and two girls), aged between seven and 11, who were on a summer camp at a university in Canada. Design and methods: This small-scale study made use of enactivism (Li, Clark, and Winchester, Instructional design and technology grounded in enactivism: A paradigm shift?, British Journal of Educational Technology 41, no. 3: 403–419, 2010), a new theoretical framework, as a basis for analysing the students' experiences and responses as they created computer games to teach others the concept of Issac Newton's Three Laws of Motion. Quantitative and qualitative data collected included student and parent surveys, teacher and student interviews, field observations and the digital games created by the students. Data were subjected to quantitative and thematic analyses. Results: The results indicated that only a small minority of students reported never feeling the positive emotions excited/happy or smart/proud during the process of building digital games. In addition, analysis suggested that creativity, engagement and new identity were the three salient traits displayed by the students when learning by digital game-building. There was also evidence that students increased their understanding of the subject matter in question (mathematics, science and technology) and enhanced their general problem-solving abilities through the process. Conclusions: This small-scale study suggests that student engagement in the game-building experience can enhance not just the learning of the game design process but also subject matter and generic skills. Thus, the learning-as-building approach can empower students to ‘take over the technology’ and become creators rather than passive consumers.},

	abstract = {Young children ages 3 to 6 play a wide range of digital games, which are now available on large screens, handheld screens, electronic learning systems, and electronic toys, and their time spent with games is growing. This article examines effects of digital games and how they could be designed to best serve children's needs. A small body of research has found that games—when well designed—can provide rich, fun, interactive experiences that can foster young children's learning, cognitive development, skill building, social interactions, physical activity, and healthy behaviors. Research on games that are not well designed has found that violent content can lead to fear, hostility, desensitization, and aggressive behavior; stereotyped portrayals of characters can lead to stereotyped beliefs about others and oneself; and game playing can consume valuable time that could have been better spent in exploratory play, direct manipulation of objects in the environment, physical activity, and social interaction. More research is needed to discover the potential strengths and drawbacks of games for this age group to improve game design and guide decision-making about game purchases and implementation. Since young children are especially vulnerable to media messages, it is important that their media match their developmental needs, interests, and abilities. New data collection methods are enabling researchers to investigate children's responses to digital games with greater depth and accuracy and to discover how those responses are associated with outcomes. For example, software can record the time spent playing a game, time spent on specific game challenges, errors made, use of help and remediation, amount of exposure to educational content, and areas of success in the game. Data can also be collected with systems that record eye movements, technologies that recognize emotional responses to games by recording subtle shifts in facial expression, and functional magnetic resonance imaging of brain activity during game play, all of which can contribute to our understanding of processes and effects of young children's game playing. The results of research using these new methods and more traditional methods will help to discover principles of game design that can help make games more developmentally appropriate and beneficial, building on the ways young children naturally play and learn.},

This paper considers the context of this shift with a particular focus on the relationship between gender-focused inclusivity-based action in the form of women-in-games incubators, post-feminist discourse, and the neoliberal context of digital games production. As opposed to rife anti-feminism and similar “backlash” sentiments, articulations of post-feminism within the digital game industry provide insights into the tensions inherent in introducing action for change within a conservative culture of production, particularly for women in the industry. At the same time, the contradictions and tensions of the post-feminist ethos allow for actions that function through this logic while subverting it. Through a brief consideration of three exemplary post-feminist articulations by visible female figures in the North American digital games community, this article explores the challenges and opportunities presented by the gaps and contradictions of post-feminism in games culture and production. It concludes with equal measures of caution and optimism, indicating future directions for study and activism.},

This paper reports on the study of two digital games showing how the combination of human coding with {EDM} has enabled researchers to measure implicit learning of Physics. In the game Impulse, researchers combined human coding of video with educational data mining to create a set of automated detectors of students' implicit understanding of Newtonian mechanics. For Quantum Spectre, an optics puzzle game, human coding of Interaction Networks was used to identify common student errors. Findings show that several of our measures of student implicit learning within these games were significantly correlated with improvements in external postassessments. Methods and detailed findings were different for each type of game. These results suggest {GBLA} shows promise for future work such as adaptive games and in-class, data-driven formative assessments, but design of the assessment mechanics must be carefully crafted for each game.},

The goal of this analysis was to determine in what ways the electronic preferences and activities of older adults differed from younger cohorts. Our results showed that older adult respondents generally indicated a preference for games that were easy to learn and play, but also challenging, with puzzle \&amp; strategy games being the most popular. Older adults also indicated that they played games alone rather than with friends. Finally, although younger adults used a wider variety of electronic devices, most older adults reported regularly using at least one device capable of accessing video games such as a desktop computer. These results broaden our knowledge of older adults’ preferences and usage patterns for computerized entertainment, as compared to a younger cohort.

Findings indicated that hallmark effects of fraction magnitude processing typically observed in basic research, such as the numerical distance effect, were successfully replicated using the game-based assessment. Moreover, fraction comparison performance as well as fraction estimation accuracy correlated significantly with students' math grades.

Software Process Improvement ({SPI}) initiatives for game development are discussed. The factors that promote or deter the adoption of process models, and implementing {SPI} in practice are highlighted. Our findings indicate that there is no single model that serves as a best practice process model for game development and it is a matter of deciding which model is best suited for a particular game. Agile models such as Scrum and {XP} are suited to the knowledge intensive domain of game development where innovation and speed to market are vital. Hybrid approaches such as reuse can also be suitable for game development where the risk of the upfront investment in terms of time and cost is mitigated with a game that has stable requirements and a longer lifespan.},

It is evaluated by two common methods; heuristic evaluation, and playtesting. Several heuristics have been proposed to evaluate playability but users still face playability problems. This paper attempts to evaluate existing mobile games using the heuristic evaluation method in order to examine the extent in which the heuristics support playability. Two sets of existing playability heuristics were used in the study. Six android games of different genres were evaluated by fourteen test participants. The study result reveals that existing playability heuristics lack the capability of identifying playability problems. These problems are usability, mobility, gameplay, and the multiplayer function for touch screen mobile game applications. Thus, there is a need for a new set of playability heuristics that extensively cover all aspects of playability.},

Software process modelling tries to capture the main characteristics of the set of activities performed to obtain a software product, and a variety of models have been created for this purpose. A process model can be used either to represent the existing process in an organisation, or to define a recommended software process. Software process evaluation assesses the quality of the software process used in a software development organisation, being the {SCE} and {ISO}/{IEC} 15504 the two most commonly used evaluation methods. Software process evaluation can be the starting point of a software process improvement effort. This effort aims to direct the organisation's current practices to a state where the software process is continuously evaluated and improved.},

Games are studied in different situations with numerous methods, but little is known about if and how the playing situation affects the user experience ({UX}) in games. In addition, it is hard to understand and study the psychology of {UX} in games. The objective of this study is to show how {UX} differs when the first-person shooter {HALO} is played in a laboratory and at home. To disclose this difference, a psychologically valid and multidimensional measurement framework is introduced. {UX} is profiled according to the level of the sense of presence, involvement, and flow in a between-subjects design. Statistically, the structure of the framework is grounded on a large and heterogeneous gamer data set (N = 2,182). The results showed that the profile of the sense of presence in the laboratory included higher levels of attention and arousal as compared with that of the natural environment. This finding was independent of any of the measured background variables. Other differences between the two situations were more related to the participants’ background. For example, gamers at home were more involved in the game and they felt a higher level of competence. No strong emotional differences between the two situations were found. The authors discuss the complex {UX} terminology and implications of the framework for implementation of learning games.},

Specifically, this essay looks at the links between the semiotic features of Jonathan Blow’s 2008 puzzle-platform video game Braid and similar elements in Georges Perec’s 1978 novel Life A User’s Manual, as well as in other puzzle-themed literary precursors. Blow’s game design concepts “dynamical meaning” and “game play rhetoric” are explained in relation to a number of Braid levels; along side this analysis is a parallel examination of the relationship between puzzle-makers and puzzle-solvers in Life A User’s Manual, revealed from a close reading of textual and organizational elements of Perec’s novel. Ultimately, Braid and Life A User’s Manual are shown to draw upon the same signifying processes, which are understood by their authors to operate within an implicitly communicative model. “Unraveling Braid”develops this model by positing a theory of storytelling in the imperative mood, in which the representation and arrangement of objects in the visual/organizational space of the text or game world becomes a fundamental rhetorical technique and meaning-maker.This technique signal show the reader/player is meant to progress through the work and interpret it as narrative, telling the reader/player what to do (but not necessarily how to do it). An understanding of “imperative” storytelling, this essay concludes, allows for a discussion of games and other media that denies neither the importance of player interactivity nor that of authorial design.},

A physiological metric for investigating social experience within a shared gaming context is introduced: Physiological linkage is measured by gathering simultaneous psychophysiological measurements from several players. The authors review how physiological linkage may be associated with social presence among participants in various gaming situations or social contexts. These metrics provide such information about the interaction among participants that is not currently available by any other method. The authors discuss various measures used to calculate linkage, the related social processes, and how to use physiological linkage in game experience research.},

	abstract = {As playing digital games has become a popular pastime among older adults, the study of the older audience of digital games would do well to exchange exploratory research for more specialist and focused areas. This article follows this reasoning and focuses on game enjoyment in later life. This topic is explored through two qualitative studies with actively playing older adults. The first study (n = 35, aged between 49 and 73) took place in Flanders (the Dutch-speaking part of Belgium), while the second study (n = 40, aged between 44 and 77) was held in the U.S.A. (Virginia and Kentucky). Using the principles of Grounded Theory, three interpretations of game enjoyment in later life were identified, namely, telic, hedonic, and eudaimonic enjoyment. The article offers a number of design recommendations based on its findings and discusses how the interpretations are influenced by context and player gender, and are subject to change throughout the life span of an aging player.},

	abstract = {The use of information communication technologies ({ICTs}) in therapy offers new perspectives for treating many domains in individuals with autism spectrum disorders ({ASD}) because they can be used in many different ways and settings and they are attractive to the patients. We reviewed the available literature on serious games that are used to teach social interactions to individuals with {ASD}. After screening the Medline, Science Direct and {ACM} Digital Library databases, we found a total of 31 serious games: 16 that targeted emotion recognition or production and 15 that targeted social skills. There was a significant correlation between the number of reports per year and the year of publication. Serious games appeared promising because they can support training on many different skills and they favour interactions in diverse contexts and situations, some of which may resemble real life. However, the currently available serious games exhibit some limitations: (i) most of them are developed for High-Functioning individuals; (ii) their clinical validation has rarely met the evidence-based medicine standards; (iii) the game design is not usually described; and, (iv) in many cases, the clinical validation and playability/game design are not compatible.
Future research agendas should encompass (i) more robust studies in terms of methodology (large samples, control groups, longer treatment periods, follow-up to assess whether changes remain stable, etc.) to assess serious game efficacy; (ii) more collaboration between clinical and computer/game design experts; and (iii) more serious games that are adapted to Low-Functioning {ASD} individuals.},

	abstract = {Serious games are games with an educational purpose. In these games, players develop their skills by facing a number of challenges, and students are assessed according to their game playing behaviour. Assessment of serious game-based learning experiences has to take into account diverse features as game genre, pedagogical aim or game context. This paper analyses how skills are usually assessed in learning experiences based on serious games. To reach this objective, a systematic mapping study of more than 400 papers is undertaken. Papers were identified and classified according to a framework based on four categories: assessment aim, implementation, integration and primary assessment type. The reviewed literature mainly deals with contributions on methods and approaches for serious games. Results have revealed that most assessment methods are applied for a formative purpose more than for a certification purpose. Most frequent implementations such as game scoring and integrations like monitoring states were also uncovered. The main primary type of assessment detected was in-process. In addition, several limitations were found in the assessment methods: regarding the aim of assessment, certification of previous or attained skills was usually implemented out of the game; the scope of some implementations was limited because results were predefined earlier; and most of methods analysed present scalability issues because they rely on manual assessments. Such findings are analysed and discussed to clarify the state of the art and provide recommendations for further work in the area of serious games-based learning.},

	abstract = {Global competition and individual customer requirements generate challenges for manufacturing companies. To cope with these challenges, companies require an increased level of flexibility. In the first place, this flexibility has to be provided by the employees, as they are one of the key success factors for mastering change. An essential prerequisite for this is a high level of employee qualification across all areas of the company.
The learning factories approach has garnered particular attention in recent years as a playful and efficient way of learning the principles and methods of processes improvement. The drawbacks of this method include the limited, non-holistic perspective of each trainee as well as the non-recurring knowledge transfer. Moreover, this kind of qualification requires the trainees to be in the same place at the same time.
These downsides can be successfully countered by supplementing learning factories with a digital learning component depicting the learning environment, as digital learning will enable individual learning routes for all trainees and is accessible at all times and all places.
This paper serves to outline the idea of serious learning by using digital learning games along with the attendant benefits. Over and beyond this, it also presents a digital learning game for teaching specific lean production methods.},

	abstract = {This study examines the effects of integrating instructional support in the form of a prompt that highlights the importance of learning from the educational game. We set out to answer the question of whether or not it is necessary to indicate an educational game as a learning material (in contrast to pure entertainment) to facilitate learning relevant for school. Research on entertainment media suggests that the implementation of such a learning instruction increases learners’ investment of mental effort and, thus, the learning outcome. Then again, learning instruction as an extrinsic incentive might negatively influence intrinsic motivation and extraneous cognitive load. Therefore, this study examines the effects of learning instruction on students’ intrinsic motivation, cognitive load, and learning with a digital educational game. We carried out a one-factor (learning instruction: yes/no) experimental design with N = 150 participants (age 13 to 17). Results indicate that the learning instruction increased task-irrelevant processing and decreased the learning outcome. Thus, adding an explicit learning instruction is not recommended. On the contrary, our results suggest that playing just for fun enhances the effectiveness of such a learning environment.},

	abstract = {Serious environmental management games can improve understanding of practical environmental sustainability challenges by offering opportunities to obtain first-hand experiences that may be otherwise too costly, difficult or dangerous to reproduce in reality. Game-based learning ({GBL}) has been found to increase soft skills, such as critical thinking, creative problem solving and teamwork, as well as to improve cognitive development, learning retention and social learning, which are important for future environmental researchers and professionals. Environmental management games can be applied in educational settings to promote awareness about sustainable resource planning and management among citizens who are increasingly exposed to products of the information age. This paper provides an overview of game-based learning and the state of serious games ({SG}) for environmental management, offering insight into their potential as effective tools in facilitating environmental education. {SGs} have been shown to possess numerous qualities that have been connected with improved learning experiences and cognitive development, but research must continue to study the {SGs}’ efficacy. Shortcomings found with games reviewed are that few evaluate or explain pedagogical foundation, and many are hard to implement or not accessible. Methods employed in determining the effectiveness of {SGs} vary greatly among environmental studies, necessitating a standardized methodology to reduce disparities in testing procedures. Furthermore, a centralized source, effectively an online database for {SGs}, is needed for locating and obtaining information pertaining to the available environmental games and their most appropriate applications.},

However, today games are also increasingly being employed for a variety of instrumental purposes. Although games have garnered a substantial amount of research attention during the last decade, research literature is scattered and there is still a lack of a clear and reliable understanding of why games are being used, and how they are placed in the established utilitarian-hedonic continuum of information systems. To address this gap, we conducted a meta-analysis of the quantitative body of literature that has examined the reasons for using games (48 studies). Additionally, we compared the findings across games that are intended for either leisure or instrumental use. Even though games are generally regarded as a pinnacle form of hedonically-oriented {ISs}, our results show that enjoyment and usefulness are equally important determinants for using them (though their definitive role varies between game types). Therefore, it can be posited that games are multi-purpose {ISs} which nevertheless rely on hedonic factors, even in the pursuit of instrumental outcomes. The present study contributes to and advances our theoretical and empirical understanding of multi-purpose {ISs} and the ways in which they are used.},

Currently, there is a lack of design processes that provide both structure and room for creative development of such games. This article presents a preliminary process for design of {DCGs}. The design process involves the application of cognitive toys and isomorphism. Using this process, designers will use a cognitive toy to be inspired to develop {DCGs}, and isomorphism is intended to help them produce a diverse set of {DCGs} based on the same cognitive toy.

Film, music videos, advertisements, video games and other forms of popular culture are shaping how students learn today. Discussions about video gaming typically have turned to concerns about a recurring narrative, focusing on violence with sexist and racist content, found in games such as Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas (2004). Today, educators and researchers recognize the potential of video games to engage players in multi-sensory, complex learning processes. Games that promote social action have become popular over the past 5 years and have represented a new genre of games that researchers from a range of disciplines are beginning to investigate. This discussion of video games examines simulation, situated learning, and social realism gaming schemas as well as social reconstructionist art education. Specifically, the article explores the videogames Peacemaker (2006) and Darfur is Dying (2006) and their potential for learning in a social reconstructionist art education context.},

While the series does not market itself exclusively to women, the narrative specifically places the player in the subject position that implies a heterosexual female. By tapping into gothic genre expectations the games help to marginalize the player within the larger scope of video games. The games play with gothic storytelling style, yet push against many traditional conventions of the genre, illustrating how digital spaces have begun to rewrite traditional narrative conventions, but still maintain their gendered affectations. Through gaming, the gothic romance premise is reproduced, but ultimately shifts the player from the role of an onlooker to the subject position of victimized protagonist.},

	abstract = {Background: The emergence of a participatory culture, brought about mainly by the use of Web2.0 technology, is challenging us to reconsider aspects of teaching and learning. Adapting the learning-as-digital-game-building approach, this paper explores how new educational practices can help students build skills for the 21st century. Purpose: This paper examines elementary students' learning experiences through digital game building and playing. The following research questions guided the study: (1) What emotions do students experience during the process of building digital games for others to use?; (2) What traits do students display when they learn through digital game-building?; and (3) What do students learn from the digital game-building experience? Sample: The participants were 21 elementary students (19 boys and two girls), aged between seven and 11, who were on a summer camp at a university in Canada. Design and methods: This small-scale study made use of enactivism (Li, Clark, and Winchester, Instructional design and technology grounded in enactivism: A paradigm shift?, British Journal of Educational Technology 41, no. 3: 403–419, 2010), a new theoretical framework, as a basis for analysing the students' experiences and responses as they created computer games to teach others the concept of Issac Newton's Three Laws of Motion. Quantitative and qualitative data collected included student and parent surveys, teacher and student interviews, field observations and the digital games created by the students. Data were subjected to quantitative and thematic analyses. Results: The results indicated that only a small minority of students reported never feeling the positive emotions excited/happy or smart/proud during the process of building digital games. In addition, analysis suggested that creativity, engagement and new identity were the three salient traits displayed by the students when learning by digital game-building. There was also evidence that students increased their understanding of the subject matter in question (mathematics, science and technology) and enhanced their general problem-solving abilities through the process. Conclusions: This small-scale study suggests that student engagement in the game-building experience can enhance not just the learning of the game design process but also subject matter and generic skills. Thus, the learning-as-building approach can empower students to ‘take over the technology’ and become creators rather than passive consumers.},

Educational digital games provide an increasing popular medium for engaging students in manipulating and exploring such models and relationships. This article applies cognitive science research on {MERs} to a range of popular educational and recreational games that focus on the interpretation and manipulation of models. We leverage the literatures on embodied cognition, adaptive scaffolding, science education, and dynamic visualizations to address the challenges, trade-offs, and questions highlighted by the research. We apply these research-derived design considerations to analyze (a) the extent and forms through which the design considerations are reflected in the design of the games, (b) the implications for designing effective model-based games for learning, and (c) the implications for future research on {MERs}.},

	abstract = {Young children ages 3 to 6 play a wide range of digital games, which are now available on large screens, handheld screens, electronic learning systems, and electronic toys, and their time spent with games is growing. This article examines effects of digital games and how they could be designed to best serve children's needs. A small body of research has found that games—when well designed—can provide rich, fun, interactive experiences that can foster young children's learning, cognitive development, skill building, social interactions, physical activity, and healthy behaviors. Research on games that are not well designed has found that violent content can lead to fear, hostility, desensitization, and aggressive behavior; stereotyped portrayals of characters can lead to stereotyped beliefs about others and oneself; and game playing can consume valuable time that could have been better spent in exploratory play, direct manipulation of objects in the environment, physical activity, and social interaction. More research is needed to discover the potential strengths and drawbacks of games for this age group to improve game design and guide decision-making about game purchases and implementation. Since young children are especially vulnerable to media messages, it is important that their media match their developmental needs, interests, and abilities. New data collection methods are enabling researchers to investigate children's responses to digital games with greater depth and accuracy and to discover how those responses are associated with outcomes. For example, software can record the time spent playing a game, time spent on specific game challenges, errors made, use of help and remediation, amount of exposure to educational content, and areas of success in the game. Data can also be collected with systems that record eye movements, technologies that recognize emotional responses to games by recording subtle shifts in facial expression, and functional magnetic resonance imaging of brain activity during game play, all of which can contribute to our understanding of processes and effects of young children's game playing. The results of research using these new methods and more traditional methods will help to discover principles of game design that can help make games more developmentally appropriate and beneficial, building on the ways young children naturally play and learn.},

	abstract = {After over a decade of scholarly research and well-documented harassment, sexism, and other forms of exclusion and marginalization, digital games culture is currently the object of heightened attention and discourse related to diversity and inclusion. This paper considers the context of this shift with a particular focus on the relationship between gender-focused inclusivity-based action in the form of women-in-games incubators, post-feminist discourse, and the neoliberal context of digital games production. As opposed to rife anti-feminism and similar “backlash” sentiments, articulations of post-feminism within the digital game industry provide insights into the tensions inherent in introducing action for change within a conservative culture of production, particularly for women in the industry. At the same time, the contradictions and tensions of the post-feminist ethos allow for actions that function through this logic while subverting it. Through a brief consideration of three exemplary post-feminist articulations by visible female figures in the North American digital games community, this article explores the challenges and opportunities presented by the gaps and contradictions of post-feminism in games culture and production. It concludes with equal measures of caution and optimism, indicating future directions for study and activism.},

This paper reports on the study of two digital games showing how the combination of human coding with {EDM} has enabled researchers to measure implicit learning of Physics. In the game Impulse, researchers combined human coding of video with educational data mining to create a set of automated detectors of students' implicit understanding of Newtonian mechanics. For Quantum Spectre, an optics puzzle game, human coding of Interaction Networks was used to identify common student errors. Findings show that several of our measures of student implicit learning within these games were significantly correlated with improvements in external postassessments. Methods and detailed findings were different for each type of game. These results suggest {GBLA} shows promise for future work such as adaptive games and in-class, data-driven formative assessments, but design of the assessment mechanics must be carefully crafted for each game.},

In order to understand how preferences might change over a lifespan, we conducted a survey of older and younger adults (N = 426). The goal of this analysis was to determine in what ways the electronic preferences and activities of older adults differed from younger cohorts. Our results showed that older adult respondents generally indicated a preference for games that were easy to learn and play, but also challenging, with puzzle \&amp; strategy games being the most popular. Older adults also indicated that they played games alone rather than with friends. Finally, although younger adults used a wider variety of electronic devices, most older adults reported regularly using at least one device capable of accessing video games such as a desktop computer. These results broaden our knowledge of older adults’ preferences and usage patterns for computerized entertainment, as compared to a younger cohort. These survey results can serve as a resource for game designers.},

To measure their conceptual knowledge of fractions eleven-year-old students played a math game on tablet computers using tilt-control to navigate an avatar along a number line for a total of 30 min. Findings indicated that hallmark effects of fraction magnitude processing typically observed in basic research, such as the numerical distance effect, were successfully replicated using the game-based assessment. Moreover, fraction comparison performance as well as fraction estimation accuracy correlated significantly with students' math grades. Therefore, the results of the current study suggest that game-based learning environments for fraction education (even using tilt-control) may also allow for a valid assessment of students’ fraction knowledge.},

Our favorites include the accelerometer, multitouch interface, {OpenGL} {ES} support, Core Animation framework, and Core Location framework. When we design a game, we leverage as many of these features as possible in order to create the most engaging and satisfying end user experience.},

	abstract = {A computer game is special software to run on a computer for enjoyment and education. A computer game interacts with a user interface and generates audio-visual feedback., In this article computer games and the relevant processes and methodologies for their development were surveyed. Basically a computer game consists of design elements and technical components. The players, stories, rules, objectives, procedures, conflicts and challenges are the design elements of a computer game. They all have conflicts and challenges and have effects over gameplay. In addition to design elements, there are technical components that may be grouped into four as ‘the render engine and rendering pipeline’, ‘physics engine and physics-related techniques’, ‘game codes’ and ‘artwork contents’. Fixed-function pipeline and flexible pipeline are the render engine and rendering pipeline. Physics engine and physics-related techniques are collision detection, ray casting, etc. Game codes are for game mechanics, artificial intelligence, scenario creation and management. Artwork contents have game level, three-dimensional models, two-dimensional maps for shaders, skeletal animation and audio assets., The major objective of the study to be reported in this article was to apply all these methodologies, techniques and tools on a case problem after studying design elements and technical components.},

	abstract = {: Information System Engineering has made the assumption that an Information System is supposed to capture some excerpt of the real world history and hence has concentrated on modeling. This has caused the introduction of a large variety of models and especially conceptual models by which an information system can be modelled in high level conceptual terms. By contrast, very little attention has been paid to the conceptual modeling process which has the purpose of investigating the requirements of the users community and abstracting from that the conceptual specification of the information system. This results in a low level of support provided to requirements engineers. However, the emphasis on system modeling is shifting to process modeling. The need for process modeling motivates the process stream of the {NATURE} Esprit project. The Requirements Engineering Process model developed within this project is the main topic of this paper.

The chapter structure will return to a more linear presentation of software engineering topics with a direct emphasis on the major activities that are part of a generic software process. Content will focus on widely used software engineering methods and will de-emphasize or completely eliminate discussion of secondary methods, tools and techniques. The intent is to provide a more targeted, prescriptive, and focused approach, while attempting to maintain {SEPA}'s reputation as a comprehensive guide to software engineering. The 39 chapters of this edition are organized into five parts - Process, Modeling, Quality Management, Managing Software Projects, and Advanced Topics. The book has been revised and restructured to improve pedagogical flow and emphasize new and important software engineering processes and practices.{McGraw}-Hill Education's Connect, is also available as an optional, add on item. Connect is the only integrated learning system that empowers students by continuously adapting to deliver precisely what they need, when they need it, how they need it, so that class time is more effective. Connect allows the professor to assign homework, quizzes, and tests easily and automatically grades and records the scores of the student's work. Problems are randomized to prevent sharing of answers an may also have a "multi-step solution" which helps move the students' learning along if they experience difficulty.},

Though it may not seem this way for those who have been in the field for most of their careers, in the overall scheme of professions, software builders are relative “newbies.”  In the short history of the software field, a lot of facts have been identified, and a lot of fallacies promulgated. Those facts and fallacies are what this book is about.   There’s a problem with those facts–and, as you might imagine, those fallacies. Many of these fundamentally important facts are learned by a software engineer, but over the short lifespan of the software field, all too many of them have been forgotten. While reading  Facts and Fallacies of Software Engineering , you may experience moments of “Oh, yes, I had forgotten that,” alongside some “Is that really true?” thoughts.  The author of this book doesn’t shy away from controversy. In fact, each of the facts and fallacies is accompanied by a discussion of whatever controversy envelops it. You may find yourself agreeing with a lot of the facts and fallacies, yet emotionally disturbed by a few of them! Whether you agree or disagree, you will learn why the author has been called “the premier curmudgeon of software practice.”  These facts and fallacies are fundamental to the software building field–forget or neglect them at your peril!},

Literature survey shows that among various software process models, Agile model is best suitable for mobile applications because it follows a combination of iterative and incremental approach which helps the project to adapt to changes rapidly. There are various Agile process models like Scrum, {XP}, Lean, Kanban, Crystal, {FDD}, {ASD} and {DSDM}.Literature survey shows that instead of using any one Agile process model solely, combining the main strength of Scrum, {XP} and Lean will prove to be an ideal software process model for mobile application development.},

	abstract = {In recent years, the way open source software is developed has taken hold as a valid alternative to commercial proprietary methods, as have the products themselves, e.g., the Linux operating system, Apache web-server software, and Mozilla Firefox browser. But what is open source software? How is the open source community organized? What makes this new model successful? What effects has it had and might it have on the future of the {IT} industry, companies and government policies? These and many other questions are answered in this book.The first chapter gives a brief history of the open source community and the second chapter takes a close look at the relationship between intellectual property rights and software, both open source and proprietary. The next three chapters consider the who, the open source community, the how, software development both within and outside the community, and the what, open source projects and product quality. Chapters 6 and 7 focus on the different users of open source software: companies and governments respectively. These are followed by two chapters that interpret the phenomenon, first from an organizational point of view in Chapter 8 and then using the theory of complex adaptive systems in Chapter 9. The last chapter explores the current and potential applications of the concept underlying open source software in other fields.},

Dr. Lawrence Peters is an industry-recognized expert with decades of experience conducting research and leading real-world software projects. Beyond getting the best developers, equipment, budget, and timeline possible Peters concludes that no factor is more critical to project success than the manager s role. Drawing on proven practices from allied industries such as business, psychology, accounting, and law, he describes a broader project-management methodology with principles that software managers can readily adapt to help increase their own effectiveness and the productivity of their teams. Unlike other books on the topic, this book focuses squarely on the manager and shows how to get results without adopting philosophies from Genghis Khan or Machiavelli. (There is mention of Godzilla, however.) Packed with real-world examples and pragmatic advice, this book shows any software development manager new or experienced how to lead teams in delivering the right results for their business.},

Management must make an honest and sincere commitment to establish this context. This commitment should take the form of a public resolution to implement risk management on subsequent projects and to make all post mortem findings input to that risk management effort. After all, lessons learned the hard way on past projects are, if nothing else, risks for future projects.

	abstract = {“Agile Software Development is a highly stimulating and rich book. The author has a deep background and gives us a tour de force of the emerging agile methods.”   –Tom Gilb      The agile model of software development has taken the world by storm. Now, in Agile Software Development, Second Edition, one of agile’s leading pioneers updates his Jolt Productivity award-winning book to reflect all that’s been learned about agile development since its original introduction.      Alistair Cockburn begins by updating his powerful model of software development as a “cooperative game of invention and communication.” Among the new ideas he introduces: harnessing competition without damaging collaboration; learning lessons from lean manufacturing; and balancing strategies for communication. Cockburn also explains how the cooperative game is played in business and on engineering projects, not just software development     Next, he systematically illuminates the agile model, shows how it has evolved, and answers the questions developers and project managers ask most often, including     ·      Where does agile development fit in our organization?   ·      How do we blend agile ideas with other ideas?  ·      How do we extend agile ideas more broadly?      Cockburn takes on crucial misconceptions that cause agile projects to fail. For example, you’ll learn why encoding project management strategies into fixed processes can lead to ineffective strategy decisions and costly mistakes. You’ll also find a thoughtful discussion of the controversial relationship between agile methods and user experience design.      Cockburn turns to the practical challenges of constructing agile methodologies for your own teams. You’ll learn how to tune and continuously reinvent your methodologies, and how to manage incomplete communication. This edition contains important new contributions on these and other topics:      ·      Agile and {CMMI}  ·      Introducing agile from the top down  ·      Revisiting “custom contracts”  ·      Creating change with “stickers”     In addition, Cockburn updates his discussion of the Crystal methodologies, which utilize his “cooperative game” as their central metaphor.      If you’re new to agile development, this book will help you succeed the first time out. If you’ve used agile methods before, Cockburn’s techniques will make you even more effective.},

	abstract = {This book illustrates how goal-oriented, automated measurement can be used to create Lean organizations and to facilitate the development of Lean software, while also demonstrating the practical implementation of Lean software development by combining tried and trusted tools.In order to be successful, a Lean orientation of software development has to go hand in hand with a company’s overall business strategy. To achieve this, two interrelated aspects require special attention: measurement and experience management. In this book, Janes and Succi provide the necessary knowledge to establish “Lean software company thinking,” while also exploiting the latest approaches to software measurement. A comprehensive, company-wide measurement approach is exactly what companies need in order to align their activities to the demands of their stakeholders, to their business strategy, etc. With the automatic, non-invasive measurement approach proposed in this book, even small and medium-sized enterprises that do not have the resources to introduce heavyweight processes will be able to make their software development processes considerably more Lean.The book is divided into three parts. Part I, “Motivation for Lean Software Development,” explains just what “Lean Production” means, why it can be advantageous to apply Lean concepts to software engineering, and which existing approaches are best suited to achieving this. Part {II}, “The Pillars of Lean Software Development,” presents the tools needed to achieve Lean software development: Non-invasive Measurement, the Goal Question Metric approach, and the Experience Factory. Finally, Part {III}, “Lean Software Development in Action,” shows how different tools can be combined to enable Lean Thinking in software development.The book primarily addresses the needs of all those working in the field of software engineering who want to understand how to establish an efficient and effective software development process. This group includes developers, managers, and students pursuing an M.Sc. degree in software engineering.},

Although {XP} presents a methodology for faster software development, many developers find that {XP} does not allow for modeling time, which is critical to ensure that a project meets its proposed requirements. They have also found that standard modeling techniques that use the Unified Modeling Language ({UML}) often do not work with this methodology. In this innovative book, Software Development columnist Scott Ambler presents Agile Modeling ({AM})-a technique that he created for modeling {XP} projects using pieces of the {UML} and Rational's Unified Process ({RUP}). Ambler clearly explains {AM}, and shows readers how to incorporate {AM}, {UML}, and {RUP} into their development projects with the help of numerous case studies integrated throughout the book.  {AM} was created by the author for modeling {XP} projects-an element lacking in the original {XP} design The {XP} community and its creator have embraced {AM}, which should give this book strong market acceptance  Companion Web site at www.agilemodeling.com features updates, links to {XP} and {AM} resources, and ongoing case studies about agile modeling.},

	abstract = {Agile - denoting "the quality of being agile, readiness for motion, nimbleness, activity, dexterity in motion" - software development methods are attempting to offer an answer to the eager business community asking for lighter weight along with faster and nimbler software development processes. This is especially the case with the rapidly growing and volatile Internet software industry as well as for the emerging mobile application environment. The new agile methods have evoked substantial amount of literature and debates. However, academic research on the subject is still scarce, as most of existing publications are written by practitioners or consultants. The aim of this publication is to begin filling this gap by systematically reviewing the existing literature on agile software development methodologies. This publication has three purposes. First, it proposes a definition and a classification of agile software development approaches. Second, it analyses ten software development methods that can be characterized as being "agile" against the defined criterion. Third, it compares these methods and highlights their similarities and differences. Based on this analysis, future research needs are identified and discussed.},

	title = {A Comparative Overview of the Evolution of Software Development Models},
	volume = {1},
	abstract = {Information system ({IS}) development began as early as 1940. Up to the 1960s, {IS} development was based on {IT} pioneers' individual knowledge, so that this period is referred to as pioneer era, and some sources even use the term heroic age. The emergence of software crisis also saw the first forms of organised and systematised software development. Systematizing and organising the development efforts was concretised through a multitude of methodologies which appeared in the meantime, and were used for determining the structure, as well as planning and monitoring development procedures. Academic and professional literature offers a multitude of definitions of the term methodology. Most definitions explain this term as a set of clear rules and principles for the application of methods and/or procedures, with the aim of resolving various problems. More specifically, in the software development area, methodologies can be viewed as a set of rules and principles for using methods and/or procedures applied when conducting development activities by pre-defined roles in the software development process, with the use of input artifacts, aimed at obtaining output artifacts as the constituent elements of the future software. Methodologies are built on theoretical foundations, and are all based on one or more development models. In this paper, the term model refers to a systematic and logical description of a development process, without detailed elaboration of activities, performers, inputs and outputs. The paper provides an evolutional overview of development models, with their comparisons, and considers the expected avenues of future development.},

In this paper we propose the timeboxing model for iterative software development in which each iteration is done in a time box of fixed duration, and the functionality to be built is adjusted to fit the time box. By dividing the time box into stages, pipelining concepts are employed to have multiple time boxes executing concurrently, leading to a reduction in the delivery time for product releases. We illustrate the use of this process model through an example of a commercial project that was successfully executed using the proposed model.},

The adoption of such a balancing approach requires a systematic customization of best practices among agile methodologies. This paper presents an empirical case study for adopting a hybrid Scrumban methodology with an integrated gamification approach, which was conducted in the context of a small-medium enterprise ({SME}). First, we conducted a focus group to better understand the potential inquiries that might have been useful to improve the development process. Secondly, we employed a cross-sectional survey approach to explore the company personnel’s opinions regarding the changes in the process. The survey data was collected from 30 practitioners who were working for the same project in a software development organization in a technology research centre. The descriptive statistics were calculated with paired sample t-tests being used to compare for integration process that contains three stages (i) initial stage, (ii) Scrumban stage, (iii) Scrumban with integrated Gamification stage. The preliminary results of this research support the idea that a set of game elements can be integrated with a hybrid software development methodology to enhance individual and organizational productivity.},

Part I illustrates the similarities and differences between Kanban and Scrum, comparing for understanding, not for judgement. There is no such thing as a good or bad tool - just good or bad decisions about when and how to use which tool. Part {II} is a case study illustrating how a Scrum-based development organization implemented Kanban in their operations and support teams. Consistent with the style of "Scrum and {XP} from the Trenches", this book strikes a conversational tone and is bursting with practical examples and pictures.

	abstract = {Osterweil proposed the idea of processes as a kind of software in 1986. It arose from prior work on software tools, tool integration, and development environments, and from a desire to improve the specification and control of software development activities. The vision of process programming was an inspiring one, directly leading to ideas about process languages, process environments, process science (both pure and applied), and to opportunities for process analysis and simulation. Osterweil, his colleagues, and a thriving community of researchers worldwide have worked on these and related ideas for 25 years now, with many significant results. Additionally, as Osterweil and others have shown, ideas and approaches that originated in the context of software process are applicable in other domains, such as science, government, and medicine. In light of this, the future of process programming looks as exciting and compelling as ever.},

	abstract = {Development processes in engineering disciplines are highly dynamic. Since development projects cannot be planned completely in advance, the process to be executed changes at run time. We present a process management system which seamlessly integrates planning and enactment. The system manages processes at the project management level, but goes beyond the functionality of project management systems inasmuch as it both monitors and controls development processes and supports enactment of tasks through a work environment. However, the process management system does not provide process automation as performed in workflow management systems. Therefore, we have developed tools for integrating process management and workflow management such that repetitive fragments of the overall development process may be enacted in workflow management systems and monitored in the process management system. Even in the case of repetitive process fragments, the need for deviations from the workflow definition may occur while a workflow is being enacted. Thus, we have also realized a tool which allows to perform dynamic changes of workflows during enactment. Altogether, dynamic development processes are supported through a synergistic combination of process and workflow management systems, integrating process planning and enactment.},

Since software projects are complex endeavors and continuously grow in terms of size, budget, and complexity, software processes are used to coordinate people and teams, to define interfaces in a multi-site project setting in global distributed development, and to provide a shared terminology and knowledge base. Since much process knowledge is available, appropriate tools are required to structure knowledge and to make it accessible. Metamodeling is an accepted technique to create structure and semantics and, finally, to allow for creating tools. However, metamodeling remains a frequently discussed topic in the area of software processes. There is a number approaches courting for the favor of the process users; ranging from small and situation-specific approaches, over vendor-based solutions/services, to generic process standards. The report at hands investigates Software Process Metamodels ({SPMM}) for the state-of-the-art, state-of-application, and tool support. The goal is to create a big picture of systematic software process engineering. We report on a comprehensive literature review for {SPMMs} (concrete metamodels, software processes that are built on an {SPMM}) and tool infrastructures to support process design, implementation, deployment, and management. We analyze the metamodels w.r.t. their appearance and their evolution, their acceptance, and how they are supported by tools.},

	abstract = {Serious games are generally considered to induce positive effects in the areas of learning motivation and learning gains. Yet few studies have examined how these factors are related. Therefore, an empirical study was conducted to test the relationship between anticipated enjoyment and willingness to play, as well as between game enjoyment, self-reported cognitive and motivational learning gains and test results. In an explorative study, 74 children from five primary schools played the learning game {AWWWARE}. The results of pre- and post-tests were analysed using multiple linear regressions. The analysis showed that anticipated enjoyment played only a minor part in students' willingness to learn with serious games. Of greater importance was the students' expectation that the learning game would be easy and instructive. The level of actual enjoyment of the game also had a smaller influence than expected. While there was a correlation between enjoyment and the motivation to continue being engaged with the subject matter of the game, no effect was found with respect to self-assessed or tested learning gains. The results lead to the conclusion that other factors, such as explicit learning tasks, instruction and support inherent in the game or supplemented by teachers, may be more decisive than the experience of fun during the game.

Like most standards documents, however, the official {UML} specification is difficult to read and navigate. In addition, {UML} 2.0 is far more complex than previous versions, making a thorough reference book more essential than ever.  In this significantly updated and expanded edition of the definitive reference to the standard, James Rumbaugh, Ivar Jacobson, and Grady Booch–the {UML}’s creators–clearly and completely describe {UML} concepts, including major revisions to sequence diagrams, activity models, state machines, components, internal structure of classes and components, and profiles. Whether you are capturing requirements, developing software architectures, designing implementations, or trying to understand existing systems, this is the book for you.  Highlights include:    Alphabetical dictionary of articles covering every {UML} concept Integrated summary of {UML} concepts by diagram type Two-color diagrams with extensive annotations in blue Thorough coverage of both semantics and notation, separated in each article for easy reference Further explanations of concepts whose meaning or purpose is obscure in the original specifications Discussion sections offering usage advice and additional insight into tricky concepts Notation summary, with references to individual articles An enhanced online index available on the book’s web site allowing readers to quickly and easily search the entire text for specific topics    The result is an indispensable resource for anyone who needs to understand the inner workings of the industry standard modeling language.},

Existing approaches to model merging make assumptions about the types of model to be merged, and the nature of the relationship between them. This makes it hard to compare approaches. In this paper, we present a manifesto for research on model merging. We propose a framework for comparing different approaches to merging, by treating merge as an algebraic operator over models and model relationships. We specify the algebraic properties of an idealized merge operator, as well as related operators such as match, diff, split, and slice. We then show how our framework can be used to compare existing approaches by applying it to two of our own research projects on model merging. We show how this analysis permits a detailed comparison of approaches, reveals the key features of each, and identifies weaknesses that require further research. Most importantly, the framework emphasizes the need to make explicit all assumptions about the relationships between models, and indeed to treat model relationships as first class objects.},

Such non-rigorous approaches often based on personal preference, intuition, or marketing hype, can lead to an erroneous result. In this paper a rigorous model for selecting a software project management tool using the analytical hierarchy process ({AHP}) is presented. The {AHP} provides a flexible, systematic, and repeatable evaluation procedure that can easily be understood by the decision maker in selecting the appropriate software project management tool. Several relevant factors based on the most common features offered by commercial off-the-shelf solutions ({COTS}) are used as the selection criteria in ranking the software project management tools. The contribution of this work is to apply a well-known decision making procedure in a novel way to help decision makers better identify an appropriate software project management tool without having to go through a more extensive evaluation process. In addition, this work establishes a framework for comparing individual product decisions across projects, project managers, organizational groups, and organizations},

Multidisciplinary nature of the game development processes that combine sound, art, control systems, artificial intelligence ({AI}), and human factors, makes the software game development practice different from traditional software development. However, the underline software engineering techniques help game development to achieve maintainability, flexibility, lower effort and cost, and better design. The purpose of this study is to assesses the state of the art research on the game development software engineering process and highlight areas that need further consideration by researchers. In the study, we used a systematic literature review methodology based on well-known digital libraries. The largest number of studies have been reported in the production phase of the game development software engineering process life cycle, followed by the pre-production phase. By contrast, the post-production phase has received much less research activity than the pre-production and production phases. The results of this study suggest that the game development software engineering process has many aspects that need further attention from researchers; that especially includes the postproduction phase.},

In addition to that, computer games are rapidly evolving in the sense that newer game versions arrive in a very short interval. Thus, software engineering techniques are needed for game development in order to achieve greater flexibility and maintainability, less cost and effort, better design, etc. In addition, games present several characteristics that differentiate their development from classical software development. This study aims to assess the state of the art on research concerning software engineering for computer games and discuss possible important areas for future research. We employed a standard methodology for systematic literature reviews using four well known digital libraries. Software engineering for computer games is a research domain that has doubled its research activity during the last 5years. The dominant research topic has proven to be requirements engineering, while topics such as software verification and maintenance have been neglected up to now. The results of the study suggest that software engineering for computer games is a field that embraces many techniques and methods from conventional software engineering and adapts them so as to fit the specific requirements of game development. In addition to that, the study proposes the employment of more elaborate empirical methods, i.e. controlled experiments and case studies, in game software engineering research, which, have not been extensively used up to now.},

	abstract = {Este tese apresenta o conceito de Domain-Specific Game Development, uma abordagem que emprega os benefícios de linhas de produção de software ({SPLs}) para criar mais eficientemente jogos digitais pertencentes a uma mesma família. A necessidade por essa abordagem é justificada pelo fato de que a introdução de conceitos de reuso e {SPL} em jogos digitais, na verdade em qualquer domínio, não é trivial, devido às peculiaridades de cada domínio. Especificamente para jogos, a Engenharia de Requisitos tradicional e casos de uso não podem ser aplicados como são. Prototipagem, rápida experimentação e requisitos baseados em emoção são preferidos em relação a requisitos de negócio. O tão popular conceito de motores de jogos é muito vago e ambíguo para definir o escopo de uma linha de produção de jogos. A experiência de jogadores é mais baseada em surpresas e rupturas do que na aderência a padrões. E nenhuma abordagem focada na melhoria do desenvolvimento de jogos pode ignorar motores de jogos, atual estado-da-arte no desenvolvimento de jogos digitais. Por outro lado, a abstração provida por eles poderia ser menos complexa de ser consumida, através de ferramentas baseadas em linguagens, o uso de modelos como cidadãos de primeiroa classe (assim como código fonte) e uma melhor integração com o processo de desenvolvimento. Dada essa motivação, Domain-Specific Game Development faz a ponte entre {SPLs} e o desenvolvimento de jogos, culminando com linguagens de domínio específico ({DSLs}) e geradores alinhados para sub-domínios de jogos e focados em automatizar mais o processo de desenvolvimento de jogos digitais. A abordagem emprega Engenharia de Domínio, Model-Driven Development e reuso de software para encapsular as melhores e mais comuns práticas do desenvolvimento de jogos, ainda suportando comportamento variável e imprevisto. Para avaliar a abordagem, apresentamos casos de estudo confirmatórios e exploratórios, assim como um experimento controlado realizado com engenheiros de software da indústria. Com uma melhoria de produtividade observada de mais de 5 vezes em média, sugerimos Domain-Specific Game Development como uma abordagem viável para o desenvolvimento de jogos que pertencem a uma mesma família, de modo a reduzir a complexidade no consumo de motores de jogos, quebrar tarefas de desenvolvimento em blocos mais automatizáveis, habilitar a criação de especificações expressivas porém executáveis, entregar valor incrementalmente para sub-domínios priorizados, construir artefatos de domínio específico alinhados às características únicas da família-alvo de jogos e, finalmente, prover flexibilidade e extensibilidade para que desenvolvedores e designers de jogos possam focar no que torna cada jogo único distinto},

	abstract = {Deliver Better Games Faster, On Budget—And Make Game Development Fun Again!   Game development is in crisis—facing bloated budgets, impossible schedules, unmanageable complexity, and death march overtime. It’s no wonder so many development studios are struggling to survive. Fortunately, there is a solution. Scrum and Agile methods are already revolutionizing development outside the game industry. Now, long-time game developer Clinton Keith shows exactly how to successfully apply these methods to the unique challenges of game development.      Keith has spent more than fifteen years developing games, seven of them with Scrum and agile methods. Drawing on this unparalleled expertise, he shows how teams can use Scrum to deliver games more efficiently, rapidly, and cost-effectively; craft games that offer more entertainment value; and make life more fulfilling for development teams at the same time.     You’ll learn to form successful agile teams that incorporate programmers, producers, artists, testers, and designers—and promote effective collaboration within and beyond those teams, throughout the entire process. From long-range planning to progress tracking and continuous integration, Keith offers dozens of tips, tricks, and solutions—all based firmly in reality and hard-won experience.     Coverage includes  Understanding Scrum’s goals, roles, and practices in the context of game development Communicating and planning your game’s vision, features, and progress  Using iterative techniques to put your game into a playable state every two to four weeks— even daily Helping all team participants succeed in their roles Restoring stability and predictability to the development process Managing ambiguous requirements in a fluid marketplace Scaling Scrum to large, geographically distributed development teams  Getting started: overcoming inertia and integrating Scrum into your studio’s current processes  Increasingly, game developers and managers are recognizing that things can’t go on the way they have in the past. Game development organizations need a far better way to work.  Agile Game Development with Scrum  gives them that—and brings the profitability, creativity, and fun back to game development.},

Games are studied in different situations with numerous methods, but little is known about if and how the playing situation affects the user experience ({UX}) in games. In addition, it is hard to understand and study the psychology of {UX} in games. The objective of this study is to show how {UX} differs when the first-person shooter {HALO} is played in a laboratory and at home. To disclose this difference, a psychologically valid and multidimensional measurement framework is introduced. {UX} is profiled according to the level of the sense of presence, involvement, and flow in a between-subjects design. Statistically, the structure of the framework is grounded on a large and heterogeneous gamer data set (N = 2,182). The results showed that the profile of the sense of presence in the laboratory included higher levels of attention and arousal as compared with that of the natural environment. This finding was independent of any of the measured background variables. Other differences between the two situations were more related to the participants’ background. For example, gamers at home were more involved in the game and they felt a higher level of competence. No strong emotional differences between the two situations were found. The authors discuss the complex {UX} terminology and implications of the framework for implementation of learning games.},

	abstract = {“Unraveling Braid” analyzes how unconventional, non-linear narrative fiction can help explain the ways in which video games signify. Specifically, this essay looks at the links between the semiotic features of Jonathan Blow’s 2008 puzzle-platform video game Braid and similar elements in Georges Perec’s 1978 novel Life A User’s Manual, as well as in other puzzle-themed literary precursors. Blow’s game design concepts “dynamical meaning” and “game play rhetoric” are explained in relation to a number of Braid levels; along side this analysis is a parallel examination of the relationship between puzzle-makers and puzzle-solvers in Life A User’s Manual, revealed from a close reading of textual and organizational elements of Perec’s novel. Ultimately, Braid and Life A User’s Manual are shown to draw upon the same signifying processes, which are understood by their authors to operate within an implicitly communicative model. “Unraveling Braid”develops this model by positing a theory of storytelling in the imperative mood, in which the representation and arrangement of objects in the visual/organizational space of the text or game world becomes a fundamental rhetorical technique and meaning-maker.This technique signal show the reader/player is meant to progress through the work and interpret it as narrative, telling the reader/player what to do (but not necessarily how to do it). An understanding of “imperative” storytelling, this essay concludes, allows for a discussion of games and other media that denies neither the importance of player interactivity nor that of authorial design.},

A physiological metric for investigating social experience within a shared gaming context is introduced: Physiological linkage is measured by gathering simultaneous psychophysiological measurements from several players. The authors review how physiological linkage may be associated with social presence among participants in various gaming situations or social contexts. These metrics provide such information about the interaction among participants that is not currently available by any other method. The authors discuss various measures used to calculate linkage, the related social processes, and how to use physiological linkage in game experience research.},

We reviewed the available literature on serious games that are used to teach social interactions to individuals with {ASD}. After screening the Medline, Science Direct and {ACM} Digital Library databases, we found a total of 31 serious games: 16 that targeted emotion recognition or production and 15 that targeted social skills. There was a significant correlation between the number of reports per year and the year of publication. Serious games appeared promising because they can support training on many different skills and they favour interactions in diverse contexts and situations, some of which may resemble real life. However, the currently available serious games exhibit some limitations: (i) most of them are developed for High-Functioning individuals; (ii) their clinical validation has rarely met the evidence-based medicine standards; (iii) the game design is not usually described; and, (iv) in many cases, the clinical validation and playability/game design are not compatible.
Future research agendas should encompass (i) more robust studies in terms of methodology (large samples, control groups, longer treatment periods, follow-up to assess whether changes remain stable, etc.) to assess serious game efficacy; (ii) more collaboration between clinical and computer/game design experts; and (iii) more serious games that are adapted to Low-Functioning {ASD} individuals.},

In these games, players develop their skills by facing a number of challenges, and students are assessed according to their game playing behaviour. Assessment of serious game-based learning experiences has to take into account diverse features as game genre, pedagogical aim or game context. This paper analyses how skills are usually assessed in learning experiences based on serious games. To reach this objective, a systematic mapping study of more than 400 papers is undertaken. Papers were identified and classified according to a framework based on four categories: assessment aim, implementation, integration and primary assessment type. The reviewed literature mainly deals with contributions on methods and approaches for serious games. Results have revealed that most assessment methods are applied for a formative purpose more than for a certification purpose. Most frequent implementations such as game scoring and integrations like monitoring states were also uncovered. The main primary type of assessment detected was in-process. In addition, several limitations were found in the assessment methods: regarding the aim of assessment, certification of previous or attained skills was usually implemented out of the game; the scope of some implementations was limited because results were predefined earlier; and most of methods analysed present scalability issues because they rely on manual assessments. Such findings are analysed and discussed to clarify the state of the art and provide recommendations for further work in the area of serious games-based learning.},

	abstract = {Global competition and individual customer requirements generate challenges for manufacturing companies. To cope with these challenges, companies require an increased level of flexibility. In the first place, this flexibility has to be provided by the employees, as they are one of the key success factors for mastering change. An essential prerequisite for this is a high level of employee qualification across all areas of the company.
The learning factories approach has garnered particular attention in recent years as a playful and efficient way of learning the principles and methods of processes improvement. The drawbacks of this method include the limited, non-holistic perspective of each trainee as well as the non-recurring knowledge transfer. Moreover, this kind of qualification requires the trainees to be in the same place at the same time.
These downsides can be successfully countered by supplementing learning factories with a digital learning component depicting the learning environment, as digital learning will enable individual learning routes for all trainees and is accessible at all times and all places.
This paper serves to outline the idea of serious learning by using digital learning games along with the attendant benefits. Over and beyond this, it also presents a digital learning game for teaching specific lean production methods.},

We set out to answer the question of whether or not it is necessary to indicate an educational game as a learning material (in contrast to pure entertainment) to facilitate learning relevant for school. Research on entertainment media suggests that the implementation of such a learning instruction increases learners’ investment of mental effort and, thus, the learning outcome. Then again, learning instruction as an extrinsic incentive might negatively influence intrinsic motivation and extraneous cognitive load. Therefore, this study examines the effects of learning instruction on students’ intrinsic motivation, cognitive load, and learning with a digital educational game. We carried out a one-factor (learning instruction: yes/no) experimental design with N = 150 participants (age 13 to 17). Results indicate that the learning instruction increased task-irrelevant processing and decreased the learning outcome. Thus, adding an explicit learning instruction is not recommended. On the contrary, our results suggest that playing just for fun enhances the effectiveness of such a learning environment.},

	abstract = {Serious environmental management games can improve understanding of practical environmental sustainability challenges by offering opportunities to obtain first-hand experiences that may be otherwise too costly, difficult or dangerous to reproduce in reality. Game-based learning ({GBL}) has been found to increase soft skills, such as critical thinking, creative problem solving and teamwork, as well as to improve cognitive development, learning retention and social learning, which are important for future environmental researchers and professionals. Environmental management games can be applied in educational settings to promote awareness about sustainable resource planning and management among citizens who are increasingly exposed to products of the information age. This paper provides an overview of game-based learning and the state of serious games ({SG}) for environmental management, offering insight into their potential as effective tools in facilitating environmental education. {SGs} have been shown to possess numerous qualities that have been connected with improved learning experiences and cognitive development, but research must continue to study the {SGs}’ efficacy. Shortcomings found with games reviewed are that few evaluate or explain pedagogical foundation, and many are hard to implement or not accessible. Methods employed in determining the effectiveness of {SGs} vary greatly among environmental studies, necessitating a standardized methodology to reduce disparities in testing procedures. Furthermore, a centralized source, effectively an online database for {SGs}, is needed for locating and obtaining information pertaining to the available environmental games and their most appropriate applications.},

	abstract = {During the last decade games have arguably become the largest form of leisure information systems ({IS}). However, today games are also increasingly being employed for a variety of instrumental purposes. Although games have garnered a substantial amount of research attention during the last decade, research literature is scattered and there is still a lack of a clear and reliable understanding of why games are being used, and how they are placed in the established utilitarian-hedonic continuum of information systems. To address this gap, we conducted a meta-analysis of the quantitative body of literature that has examined the reasons for using games (48 studies). Additionally, we compared the findings across games that are intended for either leisure or instrumental use. Even though games are generally regarded as a pinnacle form of hedonically-oriented {ISs}, our results show that enjoyment and usefulness are equally important determinants for using them (though their definitive role varies between game types). Therefore, it can be posited that games are multi-purpose {ISs} which nevertheless rely on hedonic factors, even in the pursuit of instrumental outcomes. The present study contributes to and advances our theoretical and empirical understanding of multi-purpose {ISs} and the ways in which they are used.},

Currently, there is a lack of design processes that provide both structure and room for creative development of such games. This article presents a preliminary process for design of {DCGs}.

Using this process, designers will use a cognitive toy to be inspired to develop {DCGs}, and isomorphism is intended to help them produce a diverse set of {DCGs} based on the same cognitive toy.

Film, music videos, advertisements, video games and other forms of popular culture are shaping how students learn today. Discussions about video gaming typically have turned to concerns about a recurring narrative, focusing on violence with sexist and racist content, found in games such as Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas (2004). Today, educators and researchers recognize the potential of video games to engage players in multi-sensory, complex learning processes. Games that promote social action have become popular over the past 5 years and have represented a new genre of games that researchers from a range of disciplines are beginning to investigate. This discussion of video games examines simulation, situated learning, and social realism gaming schemas as well as social reconstructionist art education. Specifically, the article explores the videogames Peacemaker (2006) and Darfur is Dying (2006) and their potential for learning in a social reconstructionist art education context.},

This analysis considers how the games in the Ravenhearst trilogy both reinforce and complicate expectations of women gamers through repurposing the gothic romance. While the series does not market itself exclusively to women, the narrative specifically places the player in the subject position that implies a heterosexual female. By tapping into gothic genre expectations the games help to marginalize the player within the larger scope of video games. The games play with gothic storytelling style, yet push against many traditional conventions of the genre, illustrating how digital spaces have begun to rewrite traditional narrative conventions, but still maintain their gendered affectations. Through gaming, the gothic romance premise is reproduced, but ultimately shifts the player from the role of an onlooker to the subject position of victimized protagonist.},

	abstract = {Background: The emergence of a participatory culture, brought about mainly by the use of Web2.0 technology, is challenging us to reconsider aspects of teaching and learning. Adapting the learning-as-digital-game-building approach, this paper explores how new educational practices can help students build skills for the 21st century. Purpose: This paper examines elementary students' learning experiences through digital game building and playing. The following research questions guided the study: (1) What emotions do students experience during the process of building digital games for others to use?; (2) What traits do students display when they learn through digital game-building?; and (3) What do students learn from the digital game-building experience? Sample: The participants were 21 elementary students (19 boys and two girls), aged between seven and 11, who were on a summer camp at a university in Canada. Design and methods: This small-scale study made use of enactivism (Li, Clark, and Winchester, Instructional design and technology grounded in enactivism: A paradigm shift?, British Journal of Educational Technology 41, no. 3: 403–419, 2010), a new theoretical framework, as a basis for analysing the students' experiences and responses as they created computer games to teach others the concept of Issac Newton's Three Laws of Motion. Quantitative and qualitative data collected included student and parent surveys, teacher and student interviews, field observations and the digital games created by the students. Data were subjected to quantitative and thematic analyses. Results: The results indicated that only a small minority of students reported never feeling the positive emotions excited/happy or smart/proud during the process of building digital games. In addition, analysis suggested that creativity, engagement and new identity were the three salient traits displayed by the students when learning by digital game-building. There was also evidence that students increased their understanding of the subject matter in question (mathematics, science and technology) and enhanced their general problem-solving abilities through the process. Conclusions: This small-scale study suggests that student engagement in the game-building experience can enhance not just the learning of the game design process but also subject matter and generic skills. Thus, the learning-as-building approach can empower students to ‘take over the technology’ and become creators rather than passive consumers.},

	abstract = {Young children ages 3 to 6 play a wide range of digital games, which are now available on large screens, handheld screens, electronic learning systems, and electronic toys, and their time spent with games is growing. This article examines effects of digital games and how they could be designed to best serve children's needs. A small body of research has found that games—when well designed—can provide rich, fun, interactive experiences that can foster young children's learning, cognitive development, skill building, social interactions, physical activity, and healthy behaviors. Research on games that are not well designed has found that violent content can lead to fear, hostility, desensitization, and aggressive behavior; stereotyped portrayals of characters can lead to stereotyped beliefs about others and oneself; and game playing can consume valuable time that could have been better spent in exploratory play, direct manipulation of objects in the environment, physical activity, and social interaction. More research is needed to discover the potential strengths and drawbacks of games for this age group to improve game design and guide decision-making about game purchases and implementation. Since young children are especially vulnerable to media messages, it is important that their media match their developmental needs, interests, and abilities. New data collection methods are enabling researchers to investigate children's responses to digital games with greater depth and accuracy and to discover how those responses are associated with outcomes. For example, software can record the time spent playing a game, time spent on specific game challenges, errors made, use of help and remediation, amount of exposure to educational content, and areas of success in the game. Data can also be collected with systems that record eye movements, technologies that recognize emotional responses to games by recording subtle shifts in facial expression, and functional magnetic resonance imaging of brain activity during game play, all of which can contribute to our understanding of processes and effects of young children's game playing. The results of research using these new methods and more traditional methods will help to discover principles of game design that can help make games more developmentally appropriate and beneficial, building on the ways young children naturally play and learn.},

As opposed to rife anti-feminism and similar “backlash” sentiments, articulations of post-feminism within the digital game industry provide insights into the tensions inherent in introducing action for change within a conservative culture of production, particularly for women in the industry. At the same time, the contradictions and tensions of the post-feminist ethos allow for actions that function through this logic while subverting it. Through a brief consideration of three exemplary post-feminist articulations by visible female figures in the North American digital games community, this article explores the challenges and opportunities presented by the gaps and contradictions of post-feminism in games culture and production. It concludes with equal measures of caution and optimism, indicating future directions for study and activism.},

This paper reports on the study of two digital games showing how the combination of human coding with {EDM} has enabled researchers to measure implicit learning of Physics. In the game Impulse, researchers combined human coding of video with educational data mining to create a set of automated detectors of students' implicit understanding of Newtonian mechanics. For Quantum Spectre, an optics puzzle game, human coding of Interaction Networks was used to identify common student errors. Findings show that several of our measures of student implicit learning within these games were significantly correlated with improvements in external postassessments. Methods and detailed findings were different for each type of game.

The goal of this analysis was to determine in what ways the electronic preferences and activities of older adults differed from younger cohorts. Our results showed that older adult respondents generally indicated a preference for games that were easy to learn and play, but also challenging, with puzzle \&amp; strategy games being the most popular. Older adults also indicated that they played games alone rather than with friends. Finally, although younger adults used a wider variety of electronic devices, most older adults reported regularly using at least one device capable of accessing video games such as a desktop computer. These results broaden our knowledge of older adults’ preferences and usage patterns for computerized entertainment, as compared to a younger cohort. These survey results can serve as a resource for game designers.},

Findings indicated that hallmark effects of fraction magnitude processing typically observed in basic research, such as the numerical distance effect, were successfully replicated using the game-based assessment. Moreover, fraction comparison performance as well as fraction estimation accuracy correlated significantly with students' math grades. Therefore, the results of the current study suggest that game-based learning environments for fraction education (even using tilt-control) may also allow for a valid assessment of students’ fraction knowledge.},

	abstract = {There is considerable enthusiasm in many quarters for the incorporation of digital games into the classroom, and the capacity of games to engage and challenge players, present complex representations and experiences, foster collaborative learning, and promote deep learning. But while there is increasing research documenting the progress and outcomes of game-based learning, relatively little attention is paid to student perceptions and voice. In order to effectively target game-based learning pedagogy, it is important to understand students' previous experience, if any, of the use of games in the classroom, and what they made of these. In this paper, we present findings from a survey of 270 primary and secondary school students in Year Levels 4–9 (aged 9–14) in 6 Queensland schools at the start of a 3-year Australian Research Council project researching the use of digital games in school to promote literacy and learning.},

We synthesized comparisons of game versus nongame conditions (i.e., media comparisons) and comparisons of augmented games versus standard game designs (i.e., value-added comparisons). We used random-effects meta-regression models with robust variance estimates to summarize overall effects and explore potential moderator effects. Results from media comparisons indicated that digital games significantly enhanced student learning relative to nongame conditions (g¯g¯{\textless}math display="inline" id="math1-0034654315582065" overflow="scroll" altimg="eq-00001.gif"{\textgreater}{\textless}mover accent="true"{\textgreater}{\textless}mi{\textgreater}g{\textless}/mi{\textgreater}{\textless}mo{\textgreater}¯{\textless}/mo{\textgreater}{\textless}/mover{\textgreater}{\textless}/math{\textgreater} = 0.33, 95\% confidence interval [0.19, 0.48], k = 57, n = 209).

Software Process Improvement ({SPI}) initiatives for game development are discussed. The factors that promote or deter the adoption of process models, and implementing {SPI} in practice are highlighted. Our findings indicate that there is no single model that serves as a best practice process model for game development and it is a matter of deciding which model is best suited for a particular game. Agile models such as Scrum and {XP} are suited to the knowledge intensive domain of game development where innovation and speed to market are vital. Hybrid approaches such as reuse can also be suitable for game development where the risk of the upfront investment in terms of time and cost is mitigated with a game that has stable requirements and a longer lifespan.},

It is evaluated by two common methods; heuristic evaluation, and playtesting. Several heuristics have been proposed to evaluate playability but users still face playability problems. This paper attempts to evaluate existing mobile games using the heuristic evaluation method in order to examine the extent in which the heuristics support playability. Two sets of existing playability heuristics were used in the study. Six android games of different genres were evaluated by fourteen test participants. The study result reveals that existing playability heuristics lack the capability of identifying playability problems. These problems are usability, mobility, gameplay, and the multiplayer function for touch screen mobile game applications. Thus, there is a need for a new set of playability heuristics that extensively cover all aspects of playability.},

Software process modelling tries to capture the main characteristics of the set of activities performed to obtain a software product, and a variety of models have been created for this purpose. A process model can be used either to represent the existing process in an organisation, or to define a recommended software process. Software process evaluation assesses the quality of the software process used in a software development organisation, being the {SCE} and {ISO}/{IEC} 15504 the two most commonly used evaluation methods. Software process evaluation can be the starting point of a software process improvement effort. This effort aims to direct the organisation's current practices to a state where the software process is continuously evaluated and improved.},

In the study, we used a systematic literature review methodology based on well-known digital libraries. The largest number of studies have been reported in the production phase of the game development software engineering process life cycle, followed by the pre-production phase. By contrast, the post-production phase has received much less research activity than the pre-production and production phases.

The players, stories, rules, objectives, procedures, conflicts and challenges are the design elements of a computer game. They all have conflicts and challenges and have effects over gameplay. In addition to design elements, there are technical components that may be grouped into four as ‘the render engine and rendering pipeline’, ‘physics engine and physics-related techniques’, ‘game codes’ and ‘artwork contents’. Fixed-function pipeline and flexible pipeline are the render engine and rendering pipeline. Physics engine and physics-related techniques are collision detection, ray casting, etc. Game codes are for game mechanics, artificial intelligence, scenario creation and management. Artwork contents have game level, three-dimensional models, two-dimensional maps for shaders, skeletal animation and audio assets., The major objective of the study to be reported in this article was to apply all these methodologies, techniques and tools on a case problem after studying design elements and technical components.},

	title = {Modeling the Requirements Engineering Process},
	abstract = {: Information System Engineering has made the assumption that an Information System is supposed to capture some excerpt of the real world history and hence has concentrated on modeling. This has caused the introduction of a large variety of models and especially conceptual models by which an information system can be modelled in high level conceptual terms. By contrast, very little attention has been paid to the conceptual modeling process which has the purpose of investigating the requirements of the users community and abstracting from that the conceptual specification of the information system. This results in a low level of support provided to requirements engineers. However, the emphasis on system modeling is shifting to process modeling. The need for process modeling motivates the process stream of the {NATURE} Esprit project. The Requirements Engineering Process model developed within this project is the main topic of this paper.

The chapter structure will return to a more linear presentation of software engineering topics with a direct emphasis on the major activities that are part of a generic software process. Content will focus on widely used software engineering methods and will de-emphasize or completely eliminate discussion of secondary methods, tools and techniques. The intent is to provide a more targeted, prescriptive, and focused approach, while attempting to maintain {SEPA}'s reputation as a comprehensive guide to software engineering. The 39 chapters of this edition are organized into five parts - Process, Modeling, Quality Management, Managing Software Projects, and Advanced Topics. The book has been revised and restructured to improve pedagogical flow and emphasize new and important software engineering processes and practices.{McGraw}-Hill Education's Connect, is also available as an optional, add on item. Connect is the only integrated learning system that empowers students by continuously adapting to deliver precisely what they need, when they need it, how they need it, so that class time is more effective. Connect allows the professor to assign homework, quizzes, and tests easily and automatically grades and records the scores of the student's work.

Though it may not seem this way for those who have been in the field for most of their careers, in the overall scheme of professions, software builders are relative “newbies.”  In the short history of the software field, a lot of facts have been identified, and a lot of fallacies promulgated. Those facts and fallacies are what this book is about.   There’s a problem with those facts–and, as you might imagine, those fallacies. Many of these fundamentally important facts are learned by a software engineer, but over the short lifespan of the software field, all too many of them have been forgotten. While reading  Facts and Fallacies of Software Engineering , you may experience moments of “Oh, yes, I had forgotten that,” alongside some “Is that really true?” thoughts.  The author of this book doesn’t shy away from controversy. In fact, each of the facts and fallacies is accompanied by a discussion of whatever controversy envelops it. You may find yourself agreeing with a lot of the facts and fallacies, yet emotionally disturbed by a few of them! Whether you agree or disagree, you will learn why the author has been called “the premier curmudgeon of software practice.”  These facts and fallacies are fundamental to the software building field–forget or neglect them at your peril!},

Here in mobile industry, the User Requirements are changing with time and change is frequent .So developers are hunting for flexible software process models that can adjust to frequently changing system requirements and produce valuable software in short duration with low budget. Literature survey shows that among various software process models, Agile model is best suitable for mobile applications because it follows a combination of iterative and incremental approach which helps the project to adapt to changes rapidly. There are various Agile process models like Scrum, {XP}, Lean, Kanban, Crystal, {FDD}, {ASD} and {DSDM}.Literature survey shows that instead of using any one Agile process model solely, combining the main strength of Scrum, {XP} and Lean will prove to be an ideal software process model for mobile application development.},

What effects has it had and might it have on the future of the {IT} industry, companies and government policies? These and many other questions are answered in this book.The first chapter gives a brief history of the open source community and the second chapter takes a close look at the relationship between intellectual property rights and software, both open source and proprietary. The next three chapters consider the who, the open source community, the how, software development both within and outside the community, and the what, open source projects and product quality. Chapters 6 and 7 focus on the different users of open source software: companies and governments respectively. These are followed by two chapters that interpret the phenomenon, first from an organizational point of view in Chapter 8 and then using the theory of complex adaptive systems in Chapter 9.

Management must make an honest and sincere commitment to establish this context. This commitment should take the form of a public resolution to implement risk management on subsequent projects and to make all post mortem findings input to that risk management effort. After all, lessons learned the hard way on past projects are, if nothing else, risks for future projects.

	abstract = {“Agile Software Development is a highly stimulating and rich book. The author has a deep background and gives us a tour de force of the emerging agile methods.”   –Tom Gilb      The agile model of software development has taken the world by storm. Now, in Agile Software Development, Second Edition, one of agile’s leading pioneers updates his Jolt Productivity award-winning book to reflect all that’s been learned about agile development since its original introduction.      Alistair Cockburn begins by updating his powerful model of software development as a “cooperative game of invention and communication.” Among the new ideas he introduces: harnessing competition without damaging collaboration; learning lessons from lean manufacturing; and balancing strategies for communication. Cockburn also explains how the cooperative game is played in business and on engineering projects, not just software development     Next, he systematically illuminates the agile model, shows how it has evolved, and answers the questions developers and project managers ask most often, including     ·      Where does agile development fit in our organization?   ·      How do we blend agile ideas with other ideas?  ·      How do we extend agile ideas more broadly?      Cockburn takes on crucial misconceptions that cause agile projects to fail. For example, you’ll learn why encoding project management strategies into fixed processes can lead to ineffective strategy decisions and costly mistakes. You’ll also find a thoughtful discussion of the controversial relationship between agile methods and user experience design.      Cockburn turns to the practical challenges of constructing agile methodologies for your own teams. You’ll learn how to tune and continuously reinvent your methodologies, and how to manage incomplete communication. This edition contains important new contributions on these and other topics:      ·      Agile and {CMMI}  ·      Introducing agile from the top down  ·      Revisiting “custom contracts”  ·      Creating change with “stickers”     In addition, Cockburn updates his discussion of the Crystal methodologies, which utilize his “cooperative game” as their central metaphor.      If you’re new to agile development, this book will help you succeed the first time out. If you’ve used agile methods before, Cockburn’s techniques will make you even more effective.},

	isbn = {978-3-662-44178-7},
	abstract = {This book illustrates how goal-oriented, automated measurement can be used to create Lean organizations and to facilitate the development of Lean software, while also demonstrating the practical implementation of Lean software development by combining tried and trusted tools.In order to be successful, a Lean orientation of software development has to go hand in hand with a company’s overall business strategy. To achieve this, two interrelated aspects require special attention: measurement and experience management. In this book, Janes and Succi provide the necessary knowledge to establish “Lean software company thinking,” while also exploiting the latest approaches to software measurement. A comprehensive, company-wide measurement approach is exactly what companies need in order to align their activities to the demands of their stakeholders, to their business strategy, etc. With the automatic, non-invasive measurement approach proposed in this book, even small and medium-sized enterprises that do not have the resources to introduce heavyweight processes will be able to make their software development processes considerably more Lean.The book is divided into three parts. Part I, “Motivation for Lean Software Development,” explains just what “Lean Production” means, why it can be advantageous to apply Lean concepts to software engineering, and which existing approaches are best suited to achieving this. Part {II}, “The Pillars of Lean Software Development,” presents the tools needed to achieve Lean software development: Non-invasive Measurement, the Goal Question Metric approach, and the Experience Factory. Finally, Part {III}, “Lean Software Development in Action,” shows how different tools can be combined to enable Lean Thinking in software development.The book primarily addresses the needs of all those working in the field of software engineering who want to understand how to establish an efficient and effective software development process. This group includes developers, managers, and students pursuing an M.Sc. degree in software engineering.},

Agile models such as Scrum and {XP} are suited to the knowledge intensive domain of game development where innovation and speed to market are vital.

Although {XP} presents a methodology for faster software development, many developers find that {XP} does not allow for modeling time, which is critical to ensure that a project meets its proposed requirements. They have also found that standard modeling techniques that use the Unified Modeling Language ({UML}) often do not work with this methodology. In this innovative book, Software Development columnist Scott Ambler presents Agile Modeling ({AM})-a technique that he created for modeling {XP} projects using pieces of the {UML} and Rational's Unified Process ({RUP}). Ambler clearly explains {AM}, and shows readers how to incorporate {AM}, {UML}, and {RUP} into their development projects with the help of numerous case studies integrated throughout the book.  {AM} was created by the author for modeling {XP} projects-an element lacking in the original {XP} design The {XP} community and its creator have embraced {AM}, which should give this book strong market acceptance  Companion Web site at www.agilemodeling.com features updates, links to {XP} and {AM} resources, and ongoing case studies about agile modeling.},

The new agile methods have evoked substantial amount of literature and debates. However, academic research on the subject is still scarce, as most of existing publications are written by practitioners or consultants. The aim of this publication is to begin filling this gap by systematically reviewing the existing literature on agile software development methodologies. This publication has three purposes. First, it proposes a definition and a classification of agile software development approaches. Second, it analyses ten software development methods that can be characterized as being "agile" against the defined criterion. Third, it compares these methods and highlights their similarities and differences. Based on this analysis, future research needs are identified and discussed.},

	abstract = {Information system ({IS}) development began as early as 1940. Up to the 1960s, {IS} development was based on {IT} pioneers' individual knowledge, so that this period is referred to as pioneer era, and some sources even use the term heroic age. The emergence of software crisis also saw the first forms of organised and systematised software development. Systematizing and organising the development efforts was concretised through a multitude of methodologies which appeared in the meantime, and were used for determining the structure, as well as planning and monitoring development procedures. Academic and professional literature offers a multitude of definitions of the term methodology. Most definitions explain this term as a set of clear rules and principles for the application of methods and/or procedures, with the aim of resolving various problems. More specifically, in the software development area, methodologies can be viewed as a set of rules and principles for using methods and/or procedures applied when conducting development activities by pre-defined roles in the software development process, with the use of input artifacts, aimed at obtaining output artifacts as the constituent elements of the future software. Methodologies are built on theoretical foundations, and are all based on one or more development models. In this paper, the term model refers to a systematic and logical description of a development process, without detailed elaboration of activities, performers, inputs and outputs. The paper provides an evolutional overview of development models, with their comparisons, and considers the expected avenues of future development.},

By dividing the time box into stages, pipelining concepts are employed to have multiple time boxes executing concurrently, leading to a reduction in the delivery time for product releases. We illustrate the use of this process model through an example of a commercial project that was successfully executed using the proposed model.},

First, we conducted a focus group to better understand the potential inquiries that might have been useful to improve the development process. Secondly, we employed a cross-sectional survey approach to explore the company personnel’s opinions regarding the changes in the process. The survey data was collected from 30 practitioners who were working for the same project in a software development organization in a technology research centre. The descriptive statistics were calculated with paired sample t-tests being used to compare for integration process that contains three stages (i) initial stage, (ii) Scrumban stage, (iii) Scrumban with integrated Gamification stage.

The vision of process programming was an inspiring one, directly leading to ideas about process languages, process environments, process science (both pure and applied), and to opportunities for process analysis and simulation. Osterweil, his colleagues, and a thriving community of researchers worldwide have worked on these and related ideas for 25 years now, with many significant results. Additionally, as Osterweil and others have shown, ideas and approaches that originated in the context of software process are applicable in other domains, such as science, government, and medicine. In light of this, the future of process programming looks as exciting and compelling as ever.},

We present a process management system which seamlessly integrates planning and enactment. The system manages processes at the project management level, but goes beyond the functionality of project management systems inasmuch as it both monitors and controls development processes and supports enactment of tasks through a work environment. However, the process management system does not provide process automation as performed in workflow management systems. Therefore, we have developed tools for integrating process management and workflow management such that repetitive fragments of the overall development process may be enacted in workflow management systems and monitored in the process management system. Even in the case of repetitive process fragments, the need for deviations from the workflow definition may occur while a workflow is being enacted. Thus, we have also realized a tool which allows to perform dynamic changes of workflows during enactment. Altogether, dynamic development processes are supported through a synergistic combination of process and workflow management systems, integrating process planning and enactment.},

Since software projects are complex endeavors and continuously grow in terms of size, budget, and complexity, software processes are used to coordinate people and teams, to define interfaces in a multi-site project setting in global distributed development, and to provide a shared terminology and knowledge base. Since much process knowledge is available, appropriate tools are required to structure knowledge and to make it accessible. Metamodeling is an accepted technique to create structure and semantics and, finally, to allow for creating tools. However, metamodeling remains a frequently discussed topic in the area of software processes. There is a number approaches courting for the favor of the process users; ranging from small and situation-specific approaches, over vendor-based solutions/services, to generic process standards. The report at hands investigates Software Process Metamodels ({SPMM}) for the state-of-the-art, state-of-application, and tool support. The goal is to create a big picture of systematic software process engineering. We report on a comprehensive literature review for {SPMMs} (concrete metamodels, software processes that are built on an {SPMM}) and tool infrastructures to support process design, implementation, deployment, and management. We analyze the metamodels w.r.t. their appearance and their evolution, their acceptance, and how they are supported by tools.},

	abstract = {Serious games are generally considered to induce positive effects in the areas of learning motivation and learning gains. Yet few studies have examined how these factors are related. Therefore, an empirical study was conducted to test the relationship between anticipated enjoyment and willingness to play, as well as between game enjoyment, self-reported cognitive and motivational learning gains and test results. In an explorative study, 74 children from five primary schools played the learning game {AWWWARE}. The results of pre- and post-tests were analysed using multiple linear regressions. The analysis showed that anticipated enjoyment played only a minor part in students' willingness to learn with serious games. Of greater importance was the students' expectation that the learning game would be easy and instructive. The level of actual enjoyment of the game also had a smaller influence than expected. While there was a correlation between enjoyment and the motivation to continue being engaged with the subject matter of the game, no effect was found with respect to self-assessed or tested learning gains. The results lead to the conclusion that other factors, such as explicit learning tasks, instruction and support inherent in the game or supplemented by teachers, may be more decisive than the experience of fun during the game.

Like most standards documents, however, the official {UML} specification is difficult to read and navigate. In addition, {UML} 2.0 is far more complex than previous versions, making a thorough reference book more essential than ever.  In this significantly updated and expanded edition of the definitive reference to the standard, James Rumbaugh, Ivar Jacobson, and Grady Booch–the {UML}’s creators–clearly and completely describe {UML} concepts, including major revisions to sequence diagrams, activity models, state machines, components, internal structure of classes and components, and profiles. Whether you are capturing requirements, developing software architectures, designing implementations, or trying to understand existing systems, this is the book for you.  Highlights include:    Alphabetical dictionary of articles covering every {UML} concept Integrated summary of {UML} concepts by diagram type Two-color diagrams with extensive annotations in blue Thorough coverage of both semantics and notation, separated in each article for easy reference Further explanations of concepts whose meaning or purpose is obscure in the original specifications Discussion sections offering usage advice and additional insight into tricky concepts Notation summary, with references to individual articles An enhanced online index available on the book’s web site allowing readers to quickly and easily search the entire text for specific topics    The result is an indispensable resource for anyone who needs to understand the inner workings of the industry standard modeling language.},

You’ll discover at what stages to prototype, test, and implement mechanics in games and learn how to visualize and simulate game mechanics in order to design better games. Along the way, you’ll practice what you’ve learned with hands-on lessons. A free downloadable simulation tool developed by Joris Dormans is also available in order to follow along with exercises in the book in an easy-to-use graphical environment.   In Game Mechanics: Advanced Game Design, you’ll learn how to:  * Design and balance game mechanics to create emergent gameplay before you write a single line of code. * Visualize the internal economy so that you can immediately see what goes on in a complex game. * Use novel prototyping techniques that let you simulate games and collect vast quantities of gameplay data on the first day of development. * Apply design patterns for game mechanics—from a library in this book—to improve your game designs. * Explore the delicate balance between game mechanics and level design to create compelling, long-lasting game experiences. * Replace fixed, scripted events in your game with dynamic progression systems to give your players a new experience every time they play.

It's a tour de force of {VW} design, stunning in intellectual scope, spanning the literary, economic, sociological, psychological, physical, technological, and ethical underpinnings of design, while providing the reader with a deep, well-grounded understanding of {VW} design principles. It covers everything from {MUDs} to {MOOs} to {MMORPGs}, from text-based to graphical {VWs}.Designing Virtual Worlds brings a rich, well-developed approach to the design concepts behind virtual worlds. It is grounded in the earliest approaches to such designs, but the examples discussed in the book run the gamut from the earliest {MUDs} to the present-day {MMORPG} games mentioned above. It teaches the reader the actual, underlying design principles that many designers do not understand when they borrow or build from previous games. There is no other design book on the market in the area of online games and virtual worlds that provides the rich detail, historical context, and conceptual depth of Designing Virtual Worlds.},

Existing approaches to model merging make assumptions about the types of model to be merged, and the nature of the relationship between them. This makes it hard to compare approaches. In this paper, we present a manifesto for research on model merging. We propose a framework for comparing different approaches to merging, by treating merge as an algebraic operator over models and model relationships. We specify the algebraic properties of an idealized merge operator, as well as related operators such as match, diff, split, and slice. We then show how our framework can be used to compare existing approaches by applying it to two of our own research projects on model merging. We show how this analysis permits a detailed comparison of approaches, reveals the key features of each, and identifies weaknesses that require further research. Most importantly, the framework emphasizes the need to make explicit all assumptions about the relationships between models, and indeed to treat model relationships as first class objects.},

	abstract = {The selection of an appropriate software project management tool, as in the selection of many other tools, is often approached using an ad hoc process. Such non-rigorous approaches often based on personal preference, intuition, or marketing hype, can lead to an erroneous result. In this paper a rigorous model for selecting a software project management tool using the analytical hierarchy process ({AHP}) is presented. The {AHP} provides a flexible, systematic, and repeatable evaluation procedure that can easily be understood by the decision maker in selecting the appropriate software project management tool. Several relevant factors based on the most common features offered by commercial off-the-shelf solutions ({COTS}) are used as the selection criteria in ranking the software project management tools. The contribution of this work is to apply a well-known decision making procedure in a novel way to help decision makers better identify an appropriate software project management tool without having to go through a more extensive evaluation process. In addition, this work establishes a framework for comparing individual product decisions across projects, project managers, organizational groups, and organizations},

In addition to that, computer games are rapidly evolving in the sense that newer game versions arrive in a very short interval. Thus, software engineering techniques are needed for game development in order to achieve greater flexibility and maintainability, less cost and effort, better design, etc. In addition, games present several characteristics that differentiate their development from classical software development. This study aims to assess the state of the art on research concerning software engineering for computer games and discuss possible important areas for future research. We employed a standard methodology for systematic literature reviews using four well known digital libraries. Software engineering for computer games is a research domain that has doubled its research activity during the last 5years. The dominant research topic has proven to be requirements engineering, while topics such as software verification and maintenance have been neglected up to now. The results of the study suggest that software engineering for computer games is a field that embraces many techniques and methods from conventional software engineering and adapts them so as to fit the specific requirements of game development. In addition to that, the study proposes the employment of more elaborate empirical methods, i.e. controlled experiments and case studies, in game software engineering research, which, have not been extensively used up to now.},

	abstract = {Este tese apresenta o conceito de Domain-Specific Game Development, uma abordagem que emprega os benefícios de linhas de produção de software ({SPLs}) para criar mais eficientemente jogos digitais pertencentes a uma mesma família. A necessidade por essa abordagem é justificada pelo fato de que a introdução de conceitos de reuso e {SPL} em jogos digitais, na verdade em qualquer domínio, não é trivial, devido às peculiaridades de cada domínio. Especificamente para jogos, a Engenharia de Requisitos tradicional e casos de uso não podem ser aplicados como são. Prototipagem, rápida experimentação e requisitos baseados em emoção são preferidos em relação a requisitos de negócio. O tão popular conceito de motores de jogos é muito vago e ambíguo para definir o escopo de uma linha de produção de jogos. A experiência de jogadores é mais baseada em surpresas e rupturas do que na aderência a padrões. E nenhuma abordagem focada na melhoria do desenvolvimento de jogos pode ignorar motores de jogos, atual estado-da-arte no desenvolvimento de jogos digitais. Por outro lado, a abstração provida por eles poderia ser menos complexa de ser consumida, através de ferramentas baseadas em linguagens, o uso de modelos como cidadãos de primeiroa classe (assim como código fonte) e uma melhor integração com o processo de desenvolvimento. Dada essa motivação, Domain-Specific Game Development faz a ponte entre {SPLs} e o desenvolvimento de jogos, culminando com linguagens de domínio específico ({DSLs}) e geradores alinhados para sub-domínios de jogos e focados em automatizar mais o processo de desenvolvimento de jogos digitais. A abordagem emprega Engenharia de Domínio, Model-Driven Development e reuso de software para encapsular as melhores e mais comuns práticas do desenvolvimento de jogos, ainda suportando comportamento variável e imprevisto. Para avaliar a abordagem, apresentamos casos de estudo confirmatórios e exploratórios, assim como um experimento controlado realizado com engenheiros de software da indústria. Com uma melhoria de produtividade observada de mais de 5 vezes em média, sugerimos Domain-Specific Game Development como uma abordagem viável para o desenvolvimento de jogos que pertencem a uma mesma família, de modo a reduzir a complexidade no consumo de motores de jogos, quebrar tarefas de desenvolvimento em blocos mais automatizáveis, habilitar a criação de especificações expressivas porém executáveis, entregar valor incrementalmente para sub-domínios priorizados, construir artefatos de domínio específico alinhados às características únicas da família-alvo de jogos e, finalmente, prover flexibilidade e extensibilidade para que desenvolvedores e designers de jogos possam focar no que torna cada jogo único distinto},

The goal of this paper is to investigate if (and how) principles and practices from Agile Methods have been adopted in game development, mainly gathering evidences through Postmortem Analysis ({PMA}). Then we describe how we have conducted {PMA} in order to identify the good practices adopted in several game development projects. The results are discussed, comparing similarities and differences on how these practices are taken in account in (traditional) software development and game development.},

There is, however, a lack of understanding of the extent to which agile methods and practices are actually deployed in video game development and with which impacts. This paper reports on a survey into Finnish game studios. It shows that Scrum and, to a lesser degree, {XP} and Kanban are frequently used in the game studios. The most positive impacts of agility concern communication, quality of video games, and finding fun and implementable features earlier.},

	abstract = {Deliver Better Games Faster, On Budget—And Make Game Development Fun Again!   Game development is in crisis—facing bloated budgets, impossible schedules, unmanageable complexity, and death march overtime. It’s no wonder so many development studios are struggling to survive. Fortunately, there is a solution. Scrum and Agile methods are already revolutionizing development outside the game industry. Now, long-time game developer Clinton Keith shows exactly how to successfully apply these methods to the unique challenges of game development.      Keith has spent more than fifteen years developing games, seven of them with Scrum and agile methods. Drawing on this unparalleled expertise, he shows how teams can use Scrum to deliver games more efficiently, rapidly, and cost-effectively; craft games that offer more entertainment value; and make life more fulfilling for development teams at the same time.     You’ll learn to form successful agile teams that incorporate programmers, producers, artists, testers, and designers—and promote effective collaboration within and beyond those teams, throughout the entire process. From long-range planning to progress tracking and continuous integration, Keith offers dozens of tips, tricks, and solutions—all based firmly in reality and hard-won experience.     Coverage includes  Understanding Scrum’s goals, roles, and practices in the context of game development Communicating and planning your game’s vision, features, and progress  Using iterative techniques to put your game into a playable state every two to four weeks— even daily Helping all team participants succeed in their roles Restoring stability and predictability to the development process Managing ambiguous requirements in a fluid marketplace Scaling Scrum to large, geographically distributed development teams  Getting started: overcoming inertia and integrating Scrum into your studio’s current processes  Increasingly, game developers and managers are recognizing that things can’t go on the way they have in the past. Game development organizations need a far better way to work.  Agile Game Development with Scrum  gives them that—and brings the profitability, creativity, and fun back to game development.},

	shorttitle = {Digital Educational Games},
	abstract = {Development of a game in the form of software for game-based learning poses significant technical challenges for educators, researchers, game designers, and software engineers. The game development consists of a set of complex processes requiring multi-faceted knowledge in multiple disciplines such as digital graphic design, education, gaming, instructional design, modeling and simulation, psychology, software engineering, visual arts, and the learning subject area. Planning and managing such a complex multidisciplinary development project require unifying methodologies for development and software quality evaluation and should not be performed in an ad hoc manner. This dissertation presents such methodologies named: {GAMED} ({diGital} {educAtional} {gaMe} {dEvelopment} {methoDology}) and {IDEALLY} ({dIgital} {eDucational} {gamE} {softwAre} {quaLity} {evaLuation} {methodologY}). 

{GAMED} consists of a body of methods, rules, and postulates and is embedded within a digital educational game life cycle. The life cycle describes a framework for organization of the phases, processes, work products, quality assurance activities, and project management activities required to develop, use, maintain, and evolve a digital educational game from birth to retirement. {GAMED} provides a modular structured approach for overcoming the development complexity and guides the developers throughout the entire life cycle. 

{IDEALLY} provides a hierarchy of 111 indicators consisting of 21 branch and 90 leaf indicators in the form of an acyclic graph for the measurement and evaluation of digital educational game software quality. 

We developed the {GAMED} and {IDEALLY} methodologies based on the experiences and knowledge we have gained in creating and publishing four digital educational games that run on the {iOS} ({iPad}, {iPhone}, and {iPod} touch) mobile devices: {CandyFactory}, {CandySpan}, {CandyDepot}, and {CandyBot}. The two methodologies provide a quality-centered structured approach for development of digital educational games and are essential for accomplishing demanding goals of game-based learning. 

Moreover, classifications provided in the literature are inadequate for the game designers, engineers and practitioners. To that end, we present a taxonomy of games that focuses on the characterization of games.},

A certain amount of visual repetition has always been accepted by players, however as technology improves and game worlds tend towards more detail, the repetition of assets in games becomes more obvious. Particularly graphically advanced games require an increasing number of assets to hide the repetition and to create believable game worlds. This paper examines various levels of asset repetition in electronic games and addresses problems that can arise. The paper describes some contemporary approaches used by artists in the industry to hide repetition, and touches on current technologies that might be applied in game development to address this problem.},

As a practice that is central to game development, it is important to better understand the interactions of social, technical, and cultural factors that result in the creation of sophisticated software artifacts, i.e. computer games.

	abstract = {In software engineering ({SE}), video game development is unique yet similar to other software endeavors. It is unique in that it combines the work of teams covering multiple disciplines (art, music, acting, programming, etc.), and that engaging game play is sought after through the use of prototypes and iterations. With that, game development is faced with challenges that can be addressed using traditional {SE} practices. The industry needs to adopt sound {SE} practices for their distinct needs such as managing multimedia assets and finding the ldquofunrdquo in game play. The industry must take on the challenges by evolving {SE} methods to meet their needs. This work investigates these challenges and highlights engineering practices to mitigate these challenges.},
